         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Theſe conſiderations may ſerve to be an Apology to others for this my Reply, and for an admonition to my ſelfe, and direction about my wholl carriage in it.</p>
            <p>They, who have read the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> whereunto this Reply is made, will teſtifye, on my behalfe, that the honour of God, and the good of the Church, both for maintenance of truths oppoſed, and for vindicating myne owne name, and the names of others, far more worthy then I, from calumny, did neceſſitate the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of this Apology. It had bene more to the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werers comfort, if he could have as truely pleaded the ſame neceſſity, as he readily pretended it. But, 1. how
<pb facs="tcp:20023:4"/> eaſily might he have prevented it, in the cauſe: either by not making an unjuſt oppoſition, or by yeelding to ſuch aequall meanes of accommodation as were propounded, or by propounding other wayes ſufficient to ſalve the ſore, or by referring the matter to the Church as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to their cognition, or by fairely ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the advice of the Claſſis (ſeing he would bring it thither) without praepoſſeſſing the Dutch preachers with cauſeleſſe praejudices, and jealouſies againſt men whom they knew not. 2. Seing due care was not taken to prevent the kindling of the fire: yet, how eaſily might it have bene quenched, when the ſmother of it began to breake forth apparently! at leaſt, the fuell might have bene ſubtracted, and it ſuffered to have gone out, and to have dyed of it ſelfe, but, in ſtead, thereof, oyle is caſt upon it to make it flame out, and the force and violence of it, is, by his booke (as by bellowes, or a ſtrong wind) driven upon the faces of thoſe, who have done, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much that they might extinguiſh it. Alas! what benefit could redound to the Church by ſuch perſonall vindications publiſhed to the world, ſeing a ſufficient anſwer given in wrighting to their written complaints would have ſatiſfyed their deſire, and ended all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among them? And, what though theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate wrightings were printed? yet, what neceſſity was there of printing any anſwer to them? ſeing the Anſwerer had many wayes to have ſuppreſſed them at the preſſe (being made privy to the printing of them, by the printer himſelfe, which I was not) and ſeeing I proteſted, in print, againſt the firſt part, which concerned me, and the Complainants profeſſed theire diſlike of publiſhing the other part of it? How tender
<pb facs="tcp:20023:4"/> I was of the Anſwerers reputation my <hi>Proteſtation</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in part, and my labour to have the booke ſuppreſſed more fully manifeſteth. For I procured that all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies unſold might be bought up, ſo that (I am told) about foure hundred and fifty, of the five hundred, were ſtopped. How he hath requited me let his booke ſpeake.</p>
            <p>And howſoever he pretendeth that the printing of that pamphlet compelled him to print, in his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, yet it is evident, 1. that he declared his purpoſe of printing about theſe matters before any wrighting was made by me, in myne owne defence, or by them, in way of complaint of their greivances. 2. that his theatning to print an anſwer to their complaints, which then were onely written, and left in the Conſiſtory privatly, and the report of one, who ſaid that he had ſeene ſome of the ſheets which the Anſwerer had prepared to print, were the cauſes moving W. B. to print that wrighting. 3. that himſelfe declared in a letter, which the freind, to whom he ſent it, ſhewed me, that he purpoſed to print an anſwer to that ſhort wrighting which was left by me, when as nothing had bene printed by W.B. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that the printed pamphlet was not the cauſe of his booke, but that he tooke occaſion thereby to publiſh that which he had before purpoſed. 4. When he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the miniſters of the Claſſis with his purpoſe of printing an anſwer to that pamphlet, they diſuaded him: yet he againe importuned them to conſent to it, threatning to get it printed in England, if they oppoſed it here. To conclude. He ſo wearyed them with impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunityes, as if his life had layne in the doing of it, that they left him to himſelfe (after they had adviſed him to
<pb facs="tcp:20023:5"/> leave out ſome paſſages which they diſliked in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py) but ſtill profeſſed that, as they did not hinder him, ſo they would not counſail him to doe it. This ſome of thoſe learned &amp; prudent men have affirmed to ſome of the members of that Church, whereby the Reader may ſee with how ſtrong a bent of ſpirit he was carryed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but upon what argument, or motives, I leave it to his owne conſideration in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Yet, if he would print, needleſly: ah, that he had not done it ſo reproachfully, ſarcaſtically, bitterly! Not that I have cauſe to be troubled thereat, in reſpect of my ſelfe, who have, in ſome meaſure, learned to be content (if God will have it ſo) to be <hi>as a lampe deſpiſed in the thought of him that is at eaſe,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. All ſorts of people are apt to object againſt the truth, that the profeſſours of it doe not agree amongſt themſelves.

In like manner I may tell the Papalls of the 26 Schyſmes in the Romiſh Church, others of the troubles in Franckford rayſed in Queene Maryes daies, about bringing in the Engliſh liturgy into that place, (for the effecting whereof they ſpared not to endanger the life of that famous Godly man Mr. Knocks who oppoſed it.) others, of Troubles about excommunications in

Hovv hot vvas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention betvveene Cyprian and Stephanus! vvhat vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and troubleſome diſſention vvas there betvveene Theophilus and Chriſoſtom! alſo betvveene Cyrill of Alexandria and Theodoret, boath Biſhops, Catholicks, boath learned, boath godly, boath excelent pillars of the Church, and yet he that readeth both their vvrightings vvould thinck that boath vvere dangerous enimyes of the Church. The invectives of Ierom and Ruffinus one againſt another are extant, and Auguſtines Epiſtles, vvherein he bevvayled the ſame.

<pb facs="tcp:20023:7"/> Did not the one profeſſe that he hoped he ſhould never dye a Biſhop? and the other that he ſhould never come alive into his country, boath vvhich things fell out according to their uncharitable vviſhes, Epiphanius dying by the vvay as he vvas returning home, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom being caſt out of his Biſhoprick, and dying in baniſhment? And theſe things came to paſſe, 1. partly, by the inſtigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others. Thus Epiphanius vvas ſtirred up againſt Chriſoſtom by Theophilus.

The Eaſterne Chriſtians beleived three <hi>hypoſtaſes</hi> in the Godhead, but vvould not admit three perſons, vvhence they of Rome thought them to be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, vvho beleived that there are three diſtinct ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Godhead. Athanaſius, perceiving that they differed not in judgment, brought them to accord, by ſhevving them that they meant one thing, though their
<pb facs="tcp:20023:8"/> expreſſions vvere different, ſo that there vvas a difference ariſing from ill ſuſpition which was grounded upon miſunderſtanding one another. Laſtly, from an ill gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Zeale, whereby (beſide the former) Luther and thoſe that adhaered to him were carryed too far in oppoſition againſt Zwinglius, about the Sacrament, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Luther ſaw, and confeſſed to Melancthon, a litle before his death, that his wrightings, in that controverſy had bene too bitter, &amp; profeſſed his inclination to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſome thing for the qualifying of them, but that be feared the ſcandall that might grow upon ſuch his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation, as is to be ſeene in the <hi>Admonition of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the County Palatine concerning the</hi> booke called <hi>liber concordiae.</hi> Thus a groundleſſe jealouſy ſharpened Luthers ſpirit in that controverſy, and a groundleſſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy hindred him from retracting what he had written.

Wherein what I have written the Reader ſeeth, but he knoweth not what I could have added, and therefore is to be intreated to ſuſpend his cenſure concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what I have ſaid till he may underſtand the reaſons whereby I am able to juſtifye ſuch particulars, 6. that, for the helpe of the Reader in comparing the Reply with the Anſwer I have inſerted his owne words every where. 7. that I thought it unaequall to cauſe the Reader to lay out his mony, and ſpend his precious houres upon a fruitleſſe diſcourſe of our perſonall concernments onely: and therefore have added many things, upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for his intellectuall advantage, whereby the Reply
<pb facs="tcp:20023:10"/> is made much larger then elſe it ſhould have bene. The benefit whereof, will, I hope, with Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, recompence his expence of mony or time upon it. Which I beſeech the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights and of ſpirits to grant for the advancement of his truth in the hearts of many! Amen.</p>

            <p>He that will anſwer <hi>complaints</hi> made againſt him, <hi>with right words,</hi> muſt be mindfull eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of three things.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for his perſonall qualification; that he be innocent of the particulars char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him. Let him make his anſwer, firſt, to his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in the ſight of God, and then,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.12.</note> from a good conſcience bearing witnes of his integrity, let him make his anſwer to men, as if he were making it to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, before Angels and men, in that great day,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, for the matter of the anſwer; that it be true and ſatisfying. <hi>True,</hi> by a double conformity, both of the ſpeech with the mind, that he ſpeake as he thinketh, and of the mind
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20023:16"/> with the thing, that he thinke as the thing is. Alſo it muſt be <hi>ſatiſfying,</hi> that, is ſufficient clearly to take away the ſtrength of all the allegations produced by the Plaintiff to prove him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: elſe it is not worthy to be called <hi>an anſwer to complaints.</hi>
            </p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, for the manner of it; that the rule propounded by the Apoſtle be obſerved. <hi>Let your ſpeech be always with grace, ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſalt, that ye may know how ye ought to anſwer every one.</hi> Where it is injoyned, that our ſpeech be well filled &amp; well ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.

The beſt riſe of a right anſwer is from a gracious heart, which is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> declared to be a <hi>good treaſure,</hi> when it <hi>ſendeth forth good things,</hi> &amp; to <hi>be full of goodnes,</hi> when good ſpeeches flow from the <hi>abundance</hi> within, &amp; to <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> when the words expreſſe the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cant:</hi> 4.16.</note> which are very pleaſing to Chriſt, (whom, for that cauſe, the Church inviteth to <hi>come into his garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; eate his pleaſant fruicts</hi>) and very delightfull to good men; as the ſavour of that oyntment, which Mary poured on the head of Chriſt, was to thoſe that were in the houſe. Thus an anſwer is <hi>well filled.</hi> And it is <hi>well ſeaſoned,</hi> when it expreſſeth godly wiſdome, and chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an prudence, or diſcretion, which inableth a man to obſerve a due proportion to the cauſes, perſons, times, places and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever circumſtances are conſiderable.

If he ſay, in the firſt; then he muſt ſhew the inſufficiency of their proofes, which the indifferent reader will ſee that he hath not done, if he ſhall compare the Reply and anſwer together.</p>
            <p>If he ſay, the complaint is unjuſt in the ſecond reſpect; it muſt be ſhewed that the cogniſance of a Church-greivance, referred to them by the members, doth not belong to the Conſiſtory, which, I ſuppoſe, he will not undertake. If he ſay the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is unjuſt, in the 3. reſpect; their owne proteſtation, in the concluſion of the greivances, will anſwer for them, that their end in taking that courſe, was, <hi>that ſome lawfull courſe might be taken by the Elders, for the redreſſe of thoſe greivances, and, in caſe that ſhould be neglected, to free them ſelves from the guilt of thoſe evills,</hi> when they ſhould have done their uttermoſt indeavours for the redreſſe of the ſame. If he ſay; the complaint is unjuſt in the fourth reſpect, as too much aggravating the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> himſelfe cleareth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof, in the preface of his booke, where he juſtifyeth the harſheſt expreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s uſed by the Complainants, &amp; the very title of the printed pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phlet, which many miſlike: ſaying, <hi>If the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints be juſt, then is the title juſt, being framed according to the contents &amp; ſpec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Of W. B.</hi> &amp; <hi>of ſuch others as haue ſubſcribed theeunto]</hi> Here it would be inquired what copy of the complaints the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20023:16"/> meaneth? If he meane the written copy: why doth he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only W.B. name, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealing the reſt, ſeeing they all ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it as well as he? If he meane the printed copy (which I call the pamphlet;) why are the other ſubſcribers joyned with him, ſeeing they knew not of it before it was publiſhed, &amp; freely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their diſlike of it afterward? If the publiſhing of it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the injury, where of he complaineth; why are the ſubſcribers blamed, who knew not of it nor approved it? If the ſubſcription to the written copy be the offence; what did W. B. more then the reſt that he is named alone? This Riddle needeth an Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipus. Is it, becauſe <hi>though he be formoſt in standing; yet he is the leaſt in underſtanding, and by the printer of the Browniſts noated to be a Simplician,</hi> as the Anſwerer ſcoffingly and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly declareth, in his praeface? If ſo; no man will prayſe his fortitude; howſoever they may his policy, who chalengeth ſo weake an Antagoniſt to the feild. Or is it, that the Reader may apprehend that to be ſome weake jury which hath ſuch a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; that ſo he may ſlight the complaint the more, for W.B. ſake? If ſo; the Reader is abuſed. For, neither was the complaint ſubſcribed by him alone, but by the reſt, (many whereof the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer knoweth to be no Simplicians) nor were the reſt induced to complaine, or ſubſcribe the complaint exhibited in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, by his example or perſwaſion. Secondly, ſuppoſe they had bene weaker men then they are: it is not ſafe for any man, upon ſuch a praejudice, to ſlight theire complaints, ſeing the Lord doth otherwiſe, who ſaith, <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poore:</hi>

               <hi>Alſo an anſwer to Mr.</hi> J. <hi>D.</hi>] As he did anſwer them, ſo he hath anſwered me <hi>alſo,</hi> that is, boath alike untruely, unfitly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiently: yet, with this difference, that upon me alone he hath ſpent more bitternes and gall, then upon them altogether; which the underſtanding Reader will eaſily apprehend to be an argument of his guilt and weaknes to manadge his cauſe, in thoſe paſſages that concerne me. For commonly, when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgement is unable to help, then the paſſions grow tumultuous, and riſe up diſorderly, at leaſt, to make a noyſe, with impotent clamours, as bores and peſants ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly aſſemble, and, with hideous ſhoutings, thinck to affright the enimy, or to give others occaſion to thinck they have the victory. But here I have a few queſtions to propounde.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Quaere. Why this Anſwerer mentioneth my name, in the title page of his booke? Is it, becauſe I am mentioned in the printed pamphlet? But, he knoweth, I proteſted againſt that, in print, in favour of him, though he hath ill requited me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Quaere, Why he wrighteth it ſo at length, both there, and throughout his whole booke? Js it to ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with any, by oppoſing me?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Quaere, concerning the matter of his anſwer: 1. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any report of paſſages made by me, in that wrighting, be proved untrue by him? 2. Whether the Scriptures alleadged by me be faythfully handled by him, or doe not ſerve fully to the purpoſe, for which I produced them? and whether all of them be alleadged by me againſt the baptiſme of ſome infants, as he pretendeth? and why he anſwerth not other paſſages, in that letter to the Claſſis, but only inſiſteth upon 2. or 3. texts of Scripture, in the pretended purpoſe whereof he abuſeth his Reader? and what end he had in pretending to anſwer, in ſuch a manner, my proteſtation, which was made in his favour?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Quaere. Why he compelleth me thus to conteſt with him, in print, ſeing, he knoweth, I have declined all contention
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20023:18"/> with him, by wrighting, or word?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Quaere. Why he bringeth others upon the ſtage alſo, both Reverend miniſters (dead and farr abſent) and the Elders of his owne Church, when he pretendeth only to anſwer W.

If he ſay, the Complainants mentioned theire na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; who knoweth not, how eaſily and fairely he might have declined any ſpeech about them, at leaſt,<note place="margin">

            <p n="6">6.

               <head>The Praeface examined.</head>
               <p>IN examining the Praeface, I may not omit to acquaint the Reader with two ſubtile inſinuations, whereby (if he be not forewarned of them) he may eaſily and at unawares be cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly praejudiced.<note place="margin">Two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til deviſes.</note>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is an old trick of Sophiſtry, called <hi>a fallacy of the compoſition.</hi> For, pretending to anſwer two wrightings (the one made by me, the other made and ſubſcribed by diverſe well affected members of his Church) he ſo confoundeth them with a booke publiſhed by W. B. (which in my printed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation I called an <hi>injurious pamphlet</hi>) as if thoſe wrightings, and this printed booke, were one and the ſame. For, having ſpoken of that pamphlet (in reſpect of the title, publiſhers and poſt ſcript) he telleth the Reader that the firſt part of that pamphlet was made by Mr. D. and the 2. part ſubſcribed by others. Who, reading theſe paſſages, would not conclude
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20023:19"/> us to be authours of the pamphlet? For which cauſe, let the judicious Reader be intreated to underſtand, that a difference muſt be made betwixt that pamphlet and thoſe wrightings. For the printed booke (wherein alſo thoſe wrightings are contayned) I called a pamphlet; not in reſpect of thoſe 2. wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings (conſidered as written for private uſe) but in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> quia implet omnia loca</note> it is properly called a <hi>pamphlet:</hi> becauſe, by this meane, that, which was before private (and intended ſo to be) at leaſt comparatively, became now, as it were, to fill all places, and to be made common. Whence it is evident that the ſame thing may be called a pamphlet, when it is printed, which yet is no pamphlet being only written. So then, if he undertake to anſwer the pamphlet, let him deale with the authors of it: my ſelfe have proteſted againſt it, in print, and all the Subſcribers (except W. B.) diſclaime it. But if he will anſwer the wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; let him deale fairely with us, and not joyne us with the authours of the pamphlet, nor abuſe the Reader by telling him of a firſt and ſecond part of the pamphlet, but profeſſe to deale with the wrighting, which he ſhall find me ready to defend, ſo farr as concerneth my part.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a common practiſe of ſubtile Oratours, whoſe cuſtome is to raiſe ſome ſiniſter ſuſpicion of ill purpoſes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments, in the oppoſite party, that ſo, whatſoever they ſhall ſay may be, either ſlighted, or ſuſpected. For this purpoſe, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to perſwade the Reader, that, partly affection to the Browniſts, partly diſaffection to Claſſes and Synods and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of theſe Churches, and partly private diſcontents have bene the ſtrong motives, whereupon theſe wrightings were made, whether by them, or me. The untruth of which ſuggeſtions will the more appeare, if we ſingle out ſome perſons whom, by name, he thus reproacheth.</p>
               <p>And firſt (not to ſpeake of the printed pamphlet, nor of any that had a hand in it (which both they and I diſclaime) I will cleare my owne purpoſe, in that threefold wrighting, whereof he ſpeaketh. As for my <hi>renoune and fame for learning and guifts

               </p>
               <p>Firſt whereas he ſaith; <hi>that threefold wrighting, was partly againſt the claſſis, &amp; partly, againſt him,</hi> the reader may ſee another politick deviſe of his to, joyne the Claſſis with him ſelfe, for his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; as if my wrighting were intended againſt them, where as I have all wayes profeſſed my reverent eſteeme of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as alſo I did in thoſe three wrightings mentioned by him, which were not at all intended, nor framed againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he miſinformeth the Reader; only I doe juſtly bewayle two things. 1. <hi>their credulity,</hi> that they have ſuffered them ſelves to be abuſed ſo much, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informations, and that, from thence, they have bene plunged, more then where to be wiſhed, into the guilt of partiality, by to much adhaering to one party, with to apparent neglect of the other, though, in this caſe, the more conſiderable. 2. <hi>Theyre injurious depriving</hi> the Church of theyre right in the free choyſe &amp; injoyment of men, whom they unanimouſly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for theyre Paſtors, without giving them due ſatisfaction the aequity of theyre ſo doing. Which a man may ſay having reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſome particular perſons, with out condemning all, and in reference to a particular miſcariage, without condemning all uſe of Claſſes and Synods.</p>
               <p>Secondy. Whereas he ſayth, that,<note place="margin">Fallacia non cauſae. ut cauſae.</note> 
                  <hi>being diſcontented that my calling amongſt them did not ſucceed, I had an hand in wrighting againſt them for not deſiring me,</hi> he uſeth another fallacy, which is, when that is put for a cauſe which is no cauſe. For, though I had cauſe to be diſcontented that my calling did not ſucceed, and that by his fault, yet that diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did not cauſe me to wright (as appeareth in that I did forbeare wrighting 6 moneths after he had hindred my ſetling there) but the clearing of mine innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy was the cauſe of my wrighting, whereunto I was compelled by his repoaches.<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>5.</hi> Anſ. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; <hi>21.</hi> &amp; Sect. <hi>40.</hi> Anſ. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas he ſayth, that <hi>comming nearer to the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts in this queſtion about Baptiſme, then to us, it is therefore the leſſe marvayle &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer. 1. Himſelfe, in diverſe places of his booke, freeth me from any ſuch affection to the Browniſts,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20023:20"/> as might cauſe me to wright againſt him, in favour of them. Therefore herein he contradicteth himſelfe. 2. Nearenes to, or diſtance from the Browniſts is but a falſe rule whereby to trye trueth or errour. If the Browniſts be nearer to the trueth, in this matter, then this Anſwerer why ſhould not I come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to them then to him? Is it not ſafe to come nearer to the Browniſts in holding a truth, then to the Libertines, in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berous errour? Will he ſay, the Browniſts hold no trueth? or, that we may not lawfully hold the trueth with them, that it may appeare we differ from them? or, that no man can wright in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe of any trueth which they hold, without ſiding againſt him? 3. It would be knowne whom he meaneth by <hi>[us]</hi> when he ſayth, <hi>nearer to the Browniſts then to us?</hi> 1. If he meane the Elders of his Church; his owne words will contradict himſelfe. For of them he ſayth; <hi>theſe three have diverſe times profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be of the ſame opinion with Mr. D. touching the Baptiſme of infants.</hi>

If he meane the Claſſis; the wrighting of the five Dutch Preachers, which, he ſayth, <hi>was by all the Miniſters of the Claſſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>with one conſent, afterwards approved and confirmed,</hi> will witnes againſt him. For there they thus expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>We doe greatly approve of his good Zeale and care of having ſome precedent private examination of the parents and ſuretyes of theſe Children in the Chriſtian religion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly when he ſayth, that; <hi>I had an hand in wrighting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt him.</hi> I anſwer, 1. If he meane my two firſt wrightings to the Claſſis: they were a breife narration (by way of account) of paſſages betweene us, that the Claſſis might rightly underſtand thoſe paſſages, about which they had bene miſinformed. 2. If he calleth that my third wrighting ſhewne
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20023:20"/> to one or two of the members, about the time of my departure from Amſterdam, <hi>a complaint,</hi> he miſcalleth it. For it was only a juſt and neceſſary defenſe of my innocency againſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reports.</p>
               <p>The ſame imputation of Browniſme he layeth upon thoſe members of his owne Church, which ſubcribed the complaints; but how unjuſtly the Reader may eaſily apprehend.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 31. <hi>p.</hi> 87.</note> For thoſe of them (who were ſuch before) have, in theire joyning with his Church, left theire ſeparation, as he ſayth, and diverſe of them, he knoweth, were never of them, nor doe hold with them, in the point of Seperation as it is urged and practiſed by them; Therefore, I hope, the wiſe-hearted Reader will not ſuffer himſelfe to be prejudiced againſt them, or me, or what we ſhall wright, or have written, by ſuch vayne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, whereof they are able and ready to aquitt themſelves in print, as may appeare, in due time,</p>
               <p>Whereas, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion of <hi>the title of the pamphlet generally diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the complainants,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>As is the one, ſo is the other. If the complaints be juſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the title juſt, if the title be a vile title, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the booke alſo vile;</hi> I anſwer. 1. He continueth ſtill to jumble the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet &amp; the complaints together, that the Reader may be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in thinking boath to be one, which is a fallacy, as we have formerly ſhewen. 2. it will not follow, that, if the complaints be juſt, the title of the pamphlet is juſt. For the very pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet (conſidered as it hath bene expreſſed) is an unjuſt thing, when the complaints might juſtly be exhibited, as they were.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they, that condemne the title of the pamphlet, doe condemne the whole title page, which they condemne for the miſapplication of Scriptures to this caſe, and too much harſhnes of language. Becauſe they hope, and ſo doe I, that theſe actions, whereof they complaine, doe proceede, but from errour of judgement, or from ſome curable diſtemper of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the Anſwerer. And then the complaint will be juſt, though the title be found unjuſt: elſe the whole title page of the pamphlet will be more juſtifyed, by many, then we wiſh it ſhould, conſidering his eminency in the Church.</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſayth, <hi>I find no juſt ground that theſe oppoſites
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20023:21"/> bring for their complaints, nor any due proofe of their many reproofes.</hi> Jf it pleaſe the Reader to examine. Sect: 4.5.6. and Sect. 23.24.25.26.27.28.29.30.31. with thoſe intercurrent Sections, concerning me, (by comparing the anſwer and reply with their complaints) it will appeare that he hath not ſo much cauſe of comforting him ſelfe againſt their allegations, as, from my heart, I wiſh he may have. That which he addeth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>the ſingle uncompounded policy, whereof Mr. Iacob ſpeaketh,</hi> ſhall be examined in its due place here after, when he ſtriketh at the ſame man againe, upon as litle occaſion given him, whom yet he might have ſpared being dead, and ſo not able to anſwer for himſelfe. At leaſt; he might have freed him from ſuſpition of <hi>Browniſme,</hi> whoſe <hi>defenſe of the Miniſters and Churches of England, againſt Mr. Fr: Iohnſon,</hi> is extant in print, concerning whom more hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, I muſt profeſſe, that I doe not find, in examining the complaints of the members, or in their private ſpeeches, that they are oppoſite to the Anſwerer, further then himſelfe oppoſeth their injoyment of that liberty and power, which himſelfe (in expreſſe words) acknowledgeth to be due to the Church. From which his practiſe ſo farr differeth, that it ſeemeth to ſweigh his Iudgement, in ſome particulars, a contrary way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore let the Anſwerer agree with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and reconcile his owne judgement and practiſe, and, for ought I know, the oppoſition betweene him and theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers will ceaſe.

                  <hi>As for Mr. D. he is guilty of nouriſhing contention in our Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nouriſhing contention in the Church is the thing layd to my charge. An haynous offence, if the accuſation be true, but, in him, a greivous ſlander, thus to reproach me in print, if it be falſe. I cannot but admire how he fell upon this accuſation, to charge me with an evill ſo contrary to my diſpoſition, and the practiſe of my whole life, eſpecially, ſince my publick employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Miniſtry. I was about ſeventeene years a preacher in London, and lived there almoſt ten yeares in a paſtorall charge. There I had much converſe with Miniſters of differing judgments, and with people (almoſt of all conditions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) of different affections, and wayes, being imployed, both in publick occaſions and private caſes: Let this Anſwerer ſpeak plainly (I challenge him before all men) whether he hath ever heard, by any credible report, that I haue bene, I ſay not, detected, but ſo much as rationally ſuſpected of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſnes, in myne owne country? And is it probable, that change of ayre, ſhould worke ſuch a change in my diſpoſition,<note place="margin">Coelum, non ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat qui trans mare currit.</note> in ſo ſhort a ſpace, that, he, who was wont to be peaceable with all, and a peacemaker amongſt many, ſhould, in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where he is but a ſtranger, and paſſant, become a nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſher of contention? But what have I done in Holland, that hath given occaſion of this imputation? At my firſt comming, this Anſwerer, with the Elders, intreated me to help them in their extremity. I did it willingly, preaching twiſe every Lords-day, till he was able, and, after that, continued to aſſiſt him once a day, whilſt he deſired it. Jn that time, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 5 mouths, I applyed my ſelfe to him with all love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, frequently viſiting him, (without once receiving the ſame courteſy from him) and faſhioning my outward comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and behaviour ſo, that no difference might appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20023:23"/> us, even when I had juſt cauſe of complaining. I began no queſtion with him, that might occaſion diſpute, though I had as good reaſon to examine his judgement as he mine: when he preſſed to know my judgment in any thing, I dealt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly with him, and, if we differed, I examined his grounds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, as one that ſought the truth, not contention; Yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I expreſſed my judgement obſcurely, if I ſuſpected a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to avoyd offending him. He firſt brought the matter to the Elders, not I, and then to ſome of the Dutch preachers, without me, and then to the Claſſis, againſt my mind. Had he told me plainly, that the meanes of accomodation propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by me would not ſucced, and that nothing would ſatiſfy, but comformity to that <hi>unwarrantable cuſtome,</hi> I had deſiſted ſooner: as I did, when it appeared ſo to be. After I deſiſted from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worke; I was ſilent, till he began to contend againſt me in publick, after he had procured the ceſſation of my publick labour, and I had ſat ſtill, in private, above fowre moneths, doing what good I might without offenſe, and ceaſed from that alſo, ſo ſoone as his diſcontent publickly appeared againſt it. When I ceaſed from the publick worke; I preached a ſermon for peace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9</note> out of thoſe words. <hi>Let us follow after the things which make for peace, and things where with we may edify one another.</hi> But may not I juſtly ſay with the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">

When thus I was unkindly uſed in publick, and ſaw that my private dwelling there was a matter of offenſe to him; for peace ſake, I removed my dwelling to another part of the country. Thus Baſill,<note place="margin">Greg. Naz. Monod. in laud Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lij.</note> in a like caſe, when Euſebius Biſhop of Caeſaria (a man, otherwiſe, of noat for his pietey and conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the fayth againſt the Arrians, under the Emperour Valens, yet) not being able to beare the eſteeme which Baſill had with the people, was drawne, by a ſpirit of Envy, into an oppoſition againſt that holy man, and laboured, by word and deed, to hinder his ſetling there, and the Nazareans and

Is there no difference betweene an humble preſenting of complaints by theſe members of the Church to the Elderſhip, that matters may be privately examined before 2 or 3 (when ſecret ſpeach with the party alone hath proved fruitles) and a proud caſting off the ordinance of God, through diſcontent, as thoſe rebells in Iſraell did? betweene hereticks, Idolatours and ſuch kind of Seducers, that, under the name of the Church (whoſe ſonnes they profeſſe themſelves to be) fight againſt the Church, and theſe, who, being a part of Chriſts flock, deſire faithfull ſhepeards that they may be kept from ſtragling? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thoſe, who killed the Prophets and ſtoned thoſe that

And, howſoever <hi>contention,</hi> which is <hi>a fruit of the fleſh,</hi> will be found in any perſons, and Churches, under heaven, whileſt that corrupt principle of fleſh (which is, in ſome degree, in the beſt men) remaineth unpurged out, which, not only figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt the ſpirit, in our ſelves, but alſo inclineth us to fight againſt others, though ſpirituall, and that upon carnall and worldly reſpects; yet, I demand, doe theſe complainants, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the injoyment of thoſe men, whom they mention, as thoſe Corinthians did about Paul, Apollos, &amp; Cephas? Doe they looke upon theſe men ſo, as to have the truth of God in reſpect of theire perſons, and to receive the word for theire authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſake, as they did? Did theſe terminate theire deſire in any one of theſe men, excluding all others, as they did in ſome one of thoſe? All that theſe men deſire, is to have a faythfull Paſtor knowne to themſelves, and approved of, and deſired by them, and of their owne Nation, if it may be, and, as much as may be, without drawing men from the ſervice of other Engliſh Congregations in theſe Countryes, ſo long as ſome fitt and free men may be had, either immediatly from England, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in theſe parts. Hereupon they deſired Mr. Parker: Jf they may not be ſo happy as to injoy him; Mr. Forbes. If not him; Dr. Ames: if not him; Mr. Peter: If not him; Mr. Hooker; If not him; <hi>itur ad me.</hi> If none of theſe, yet ſome faythfull one, whom, with joynt conſent, they ſhall chuſe. Yet, if ſufficient reaſon be not given them, why they are deprived of all, or any of theſe; they find themſelves aggreived, and complaine to the Conſiſtory of their owne Church. And, is this ſuch a <hi>Piaculum,</hi> a crime, as this Anſwerer intimateth it to be? And is there no difference betweene the Chriſtian Corinthians going to Law amongſt the Heathen (neglecting ſuch meanes of compoſing differences as might be had in the Church) and theſe men ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king help from the Church for redreſſe of the Church-grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances? That they had cauſe to complaine, will appeare in the reply to the Anſwerer, in the following Sections, and that, upon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20023:25"/> ſuch cauſe, in caſe of obſtinacy, on his part, they had power to have proceeded further then they did, in that complaint, who knoweth not?

But it may be, they did that too contentiouſly; Jt will not be found ſo, upon tryall, no, not in this act of exhibiting their greivances in theyr owne Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, if all the earneſt intreatyes, large offers for the poore, &amp; other meanes uſed by them, for the obtaining of their deſire, the neceſſity of the place, the inconvenience which already they felt in the ſo long want of one, the qualities of the men, of whom he deprived them, the inſufficiency of the pretences; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he did ſo, and their diſpayre of being accomodated, to their content, be aequally and judiciouſly conſidered.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20023:25"/> interpoſed ſeaſonably and ſtrenuouſly for the prevention of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine diſſentions, and for the making up of breaches within, and not, by ſuch a courſe, to have occaſioned a diviſion among the members, through their falling into ſeverall partyes. And yet, even they, who ſeeme herein to adhaere to him, doe it not, out of approbation of his carriage in this particular, nor out of oppoſition againſt me, whom themſelves profeſſe to deſire, but out of perſonall enmity againſt ſome of the Complainants, who appeared moſt to labour for my ſetling there, and therefore willingly they layd hold of this opportunity, and ſerved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it, for the more plauſible and undiſcernable venting of their diſaffection to them, by oppoſition againſt them, under a pretence of ſtanding for the Anſwerer.</p>
               <p>Here he quarelleth the Complainants 1. For ſtiling themſelves <hi>burthened and oppreſſed,</hi> which is, as if a Father ſhould beate his children till they cry, and then beate them againe for crying. How unjuſt this paſſage is, will appeare in the examination of the enſuing Sections. 2. For calling themſelves <hi>members of the Engliſh Church.</hi> How unreaſonable this reproofe is, may eaſily be perceived. For, what though the words were underſtood, as <hi>meaning the body of the Church</hi> (which yet is not neceſſary) &amp; that <hi>the greateſt part of the congregation</hi> were otherwiſe minded, which yet is not ſo? will it thence follow, that <hi>their words are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe?</hi> I trowe not.

               <p>Firſt, By conceſſion; that <hi>the yeare</hi> 1634. <hi>was a time of much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of the Churches in Dutchland,</hi> &amp; therefore might ſeeme ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable for the warning of the Churches in Holland to take ſome courſe for a timely prevention of like judgements upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by a due reformation of things amiſſe. 2.

               </p>
               <p>But they ſay. 1 they knew not if it, 2 neither did he keep pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate (as mourners uſe to doe) but came to the Conſiſtory, 3 nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they apprehend the death of that mayd to be ſo great a cauſe of ſorrow to him, as is here intimated, for reaſons which are not worth the printing. 4 that, if it had bene ſo; they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceive, that private greifes ſhould not hinder the redreſſe of publick greivances, and that, by the ſenſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> owne ſorrow that day, for the loſſe of one mayd ſervant, he might have bene more affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with compaſſion towards them who had many dayes mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the loſſe of more then one Paſtor, whom God had, by his providence, brought among them, &amp; almoſt caſt upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſame obſervation may <hi>be retorted</hi> upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, both for the yeare, and the moneth. 1. <hi>The yeare,</hi> wherein his booke was printed, was the yeare 1635. A time, when, not only the Churches of Dutchland were in great affliction, but alſo the Churches in the Low Countryes were in great danger (the Prince of Orange being then in Brabant, and the Armyes in ſome diſtreſſe, by want of victuall) a time, wherein, by ſpeciall order from the <hi>States Generall,</hi> all Churches were called upon to meete one day in a week, in publick, to heare the word preached, and to pray for the good ſucceſſe of the Prince, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20023:26"/> of the Armyes. And we are commanded, as in all prayer, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, when we pray for thoſe in authority,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8</note> to <hi>lift up pure hands without wrath, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>The moneth,</hi> wherein it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, was Iune, or Iuly, a time when I was very weake, having bene, not long before, very neare unto death, at which time he laboured importunately with the Claſſis for their conſent to the printing of this booke. But from that death, and from dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous relapſes afterwards into weaknes and diſtemper the Lord in mercy recovered me, even when man cruelly added ſorrow to my affliction. But I wil aggravate that no further.</p>
               <p>How well he performeth his purpoſe of <hi>not doing the leaſt wrong to thoſe,</hi> againſt whom he wrighteth, will appeare to the indifferent Reader, in the examination of the following Sections, in which, if he had dealt accordingly, I might haue bene happily freed from this unpleaſing taſke, whereby I am now unwillingly detayned from more profitable imployments, being compelled hereunto, by neceſſity, for the juſtifying of the truth: wherein I doe humbly beſeech the God of trueth (who alſo is Love) to aſſiſt me with the ſpirit of trueth and of love, that I may be inabled in every paſſage to declare the trueth in love! To conclude: I leaue it to the Reade to judge, whether ſo to contend be worthy of ſuch a cenſure, as this Anſwerer layeth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, or of any blame at all, for the matter of it, and the thing done, unles, in the manner of it, any unwarrantable diſtemper of affections or paſſions have appeared in the <hi>complainants,</hi> which, if it be found, I will not juſtifye, neither will they, I hope, juſtify it in them ſelves. So much be noated for the vindication of theire complaints.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Now, being called,<note place="margin">See more concerning that wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Sect. <hi>22. 4</hi> Things in defence of my wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> I muſt cleare <hi>the wrighting left by me</hi> from his unjuſt intimations againſt it. For which purpoſe I will declare fowre things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the wrighting <hi>(qua tale)</hi> is not to be blamed. Suppoſe I had complained; Is it unjuſt to wright downe a mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints? Then, downe with all courts of Iuſtice, where ſuits &amp; cauſes are ſo tranſacted. And my caſe was ſuch, as I could not be righted againſt many injurious reports, purpoſing to leave this country, otherwiſe then by wrighting. Againe, a man wrighteth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20023:27"/> with more deliberation, and a more full recollection of his thoughts, then he ſpeaketh, and ſo with more ſtrength, as the ſcattered beames of the Sun heate more intenſly and vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being united in a burning glaſſe. And, laſtly, I would haue added that a man wrighteth with more compoſednes of mind, and a better temper of ſpirit, then he uſually ſpeaketh, and ſo with more ſolid judgment, the paſſions being ſomewhat quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and allayed (as the water is cleare and tranſparent, after the mudd is ſetled in the bottom) but that the diſtempered paſſions appearing in the Anſwerer, and that in print, are a reall confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Neither was the ſecret ſpreading of the wrighting a fault, but rather an Argument of my tender care of his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that I deſired that matters betweene us ſhould not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, but only declared where it was neceſſary, for their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, who had bene praejudiced againſt me, by untrue reports of paſſages. Or, if the delivery of a wrighting to a freind or two, in myne owne defenſe, was to be blamed; what ſhall be ſayd to him, 1. Who provoked me thereunto, both by private ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and by publick injuryes? 2 Who him ſelfe did the ſame thing, without being provoked thereunto by me. For he wrote a large letter to one Mr. B. at N. in England dated Septemb. 26. (in which moneth alſo he had revived contention in publick, after I had ſatt downe quietly almoſt 5 moneths) and with this he ſent incloſed a copy of the wrighting of the 5 Miniſters, which I never did, becauſe I tooke it to be a private wrighting, not to be communicated, without their conſent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Neither was that wrighting <hi>a complaint,</hi> (if actions be denominated from their ends) but rather an <hi>Apology,</hi> or true defenſe of my innocency (againſt untrue reports about my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Claſſis, and about the queſtion concerning promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous baptizing of all that are preſented, by whom ſoeuer, and about paſſages betweene the Anſwerer and me) being frequently importuned by ſome freinds to giue them myne anſwers to ſuch objections, that they might be inabled to ſatiſfy others that were praejudiced unjuſtly againſt me. So that, in my intent, it was an Apology: if, by accident, it became a complaint; who is to be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20023:27"/> blamed; He that complaineth? or he that gave the cauſe? let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. Here is an old fallacy,<note place="margin">No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſae, ut cauſae.</note> when my wrighting is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the cauſe of their complaints, which was not. For they complained of many of the greivances mentioned in that wrighting, not only, before my wrighting was ſeene, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaw Amſterdam. And, though they make ſome complaints which agree with ſome paſſages in my wrighting, yet they make many more alſo, which are not in my wrighting. Who <hi>watered thoſe rootes?</hi> So much ſhall ſuffice for the vindicating of my ſelfe from the imputation of contentiouſnes, and of my wrighting, from the cenſure of watering evill weeds of unjuſt complaints.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Every ſeceſſion from a true Church, is not a breach of vnity: for there is a negative ſeceſſion as well as a poſitive one. And the former may be lawfull, in ſome caſes, wherein the latter is not warrantable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the caſe may be ſuch, in a poſitive ſeceſſion, as it may be diſputable, whether it be to be called a Schyſme, or not. Mr. Cartwright declareth, out of Theodoret, how the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks which maintayned the fayth, of the Nicene Councill, through affection to their teachers (of whom they were unjuſtly deprived) ſevered themſelves into ſeverall companies: and, there upon demands, will the Anſwerer ſay that theſe mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were Schyſmaticall?

               <p>Fourthly, Every poſitive ſeceſſion (or Schyſme) is not to be imputed to the Schyſmaticall diſpoſition of thoſe, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves, but ſometimes to the injurious, dealing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For inſtance. Vnder Arcadius the Emperour, a great Schyſme was rayſed in Conſtantinople, whereof Socrates ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſomewhat, but Sozomen much more. Who was the author of that Schyſme? Were thoſe Orthodox Chriſtians (Biſhops, Preſbyters, and people) who, being incenſed by the indignity of the thing, &amp; not being able to beare the ill uſage of ſo learned &amp; pious a man, as Chriſoſtom, then unjuſtly baniſhed, aſſembled a part, &amp; forſooke the reſt of the Church, were, I ſay, theſe bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as men of a Schyſmaticall diſpoſition? No. the blame of it was layed upon Theophilus Biſhop of Alexandria, who, out of Envy, practiſed againſt Chriſoſtom, &amp; prevayled ſo far, that, that holy man was caſt out of his Biſhoprick,<note place="margin">Theod: lib: <hi>3.</hi> cap: <hi>5.</hi>

Cap. 5) both The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret and Euſebius blame not the Catholicks, but Liberius for that, who, though he deſired to make up the breach, yet, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his imprudence, made it worſe, by too partially favouring the party of Euſtathius, with neglect of Meletius. Theſe things I noate, not to incourage ſuch diſſentions (the ſad eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, both of the former, which laſted 35 yeares, &amp; of the latter, which continued 85 yeares, will, (I hope) ſufficiently forwarne the godly wiſe thereof) but to warne others (viz Paſtors &amp; Claſſes) to take heed, leaſt they, the one, by needles oppoſition againſt thoſe, whom the people reverence &amp; deſire for their miniſters, &amp; the other, by partial adhaering to the one party more then is meet, and ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall) make themſelves the authours of diſturbance, &amp; diſſention in the Church, whereof they ſeeme to complaine: alwayes reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </label> but for an account of the proceeding of this Anſwerer, in the buiſines of my call; neither did I endeavour ſo much to ſhew the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of my Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the reaſons for which my calling did not ſucceed, as diverſe of them expected it ſhould. My pleading with them was more to convince them, that they could not, without injury, joyne with this Anſwerer to bind me to reſt in the judgement of the 5 Miniſters, then to ſhew them the reaſons of my opinion, in the controverted point.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what convincing power was wanting in thoſe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, rather then allegations, which I gave in wrighting to the Claſſis, ſome other had need to manifeſt: for the Anſwerer hath not done it, who, of 20 ſheetes of paper, ſpends 18 upon perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all invectives (as being a ſubject more ſuiting with his Genius) &amp; not 2 ſheets upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> matters doctrinall, to ſatisfye mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, about the ſoundnes of his judgement, and his upright cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in this buiſnes.

But, if any one will undertake it, I doubt not, with Gods aſſiſtance, to be able to reply, and, in the meane ſpace, I pray the reader, that, if any ſuch treatiſe be publiſhed, he will be ſo aequall to me as to ſuſpend his cenſure, till my reply may come forth, and I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him he ſhall have no cauſe to repent of that aequanimity, in the end.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If my allegations to the Claſſis may not ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of injurious dealing; let him ſhew their inſufficiency for that purpoſe: elſe he cannot ſo eaſily rubb off the guilt of obſtinacy, as he imagineth. And, if, in private diſcourſe with him, I anſwered all his allegations and praetences in defenſe of promiſcuous baptizing all that are brought, ſo as his replyes were ſilenced in that point, let him take heed that he have not contracted the guilt of a double obſtinacy.</p>
               <p>In the inſuing paſſages, wherein my name is not mentioned, the Reader will, I ſuppoſe, eaſily apprehend that the Anſwerers purpoſe was, not only to defend himſelfe, but alſo to reach ſome blowes to ſome body elſe. If I am the man he aymeth at (as who can thinck otherwiſe) I muſt crave leave to ſpeake fooliſhly in myne owne prayſe, being compelled thereunto, that I may fitly reply upon his 4 anſwers to their teſtification, which he calleth his comforts.</p>

                  </note> I will reduce the proofes of it to three heads. 1 Texts of Scripture. 2 Conſent of times. 3 Evidence of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The firſt text is in Act: 1 where, at a meeting of about 120 perſons, the choyſe of one to ſucceed in the place of Iudas being propounded by Peter, the multitude pitched upon two men, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph ſurnamed luſtus, and Matthias, whom they eſteemed mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for that worke,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 24.25.</note> in reference to the deſcription which Peter had before given of the man, that might be judged fitt for that miniſtry: having conſidered and concluded of two men, whom they knew, and judged to be ſuch as beſt anſwered that deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they commended them to God in prayer, and, becauſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles muſt be immediately called of God, they gave forth lotts, which fell upon Matthias, whom thereupon they num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the eleven Apoſtles.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 26.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Here are three Actors, the Apoſtles calling upon the people to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20023:34"/> chuſe, and directing them therein, according to the mind of Chriſt; the people freely nominating thoſe whom they judged fitteſt, according to that direction, and leaving that to the Lord which was peculiar and proper to him, in ſuch an extraordinary caſe, to declare immediatly which of thoſe two, whom they had nominated, it pleaſed him to ſett apart to the Apoſtleſhip. Hence I argue, that.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles did not chuſe Ioſeph and Matthias alone, but the wholl Church choſe them, by conſent.</p>
               <p>Therefore the choyſe of the Miniſter belongeth, not to ſome few, how learned ſoever, but to the wholl Church.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>1</label> What can be excepted againſt this Argument? That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not chuſe them, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> but deſired God that he would chuſe one? But 1. ſo much as, in that caſe, could be left to the people, the Lord left to them, viz, the nomination of two, which was an inchoat choyſe, ſeing the full choyſe muſt be made of God immediately, the nature of that office ſo requiring. 2. He ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted no other power, under himſelfe, above the Church, no, not the Apoſtles themſelves, in that caſe. What then? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>2</label> That this is an extraordinary caſe, and toucheth not the calling of ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors?<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> But, though the choyſe by God immediately ſignified in the uſe of lots is extraordinary, yet the ſuffrage of the people is ordinary. Which ſeing God would not ſuffer to be neglected, in ſuch an extraordinary caſe, much leſſe will he diſpenſe with the rejecting of it ordinarily.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.1.</note>The ſecond Text is Acts 6 where the multitude (the number of Diſciples being, by this time, increaſed and multiplyed) are called together about the choyſe of a Deacon.

                  </note>If the Apoſtles would not chuſe, even Deacons, without the

               <p>In the time of the Apoſtles, the power of chuſing was in the people, without whoſe conſent and preceding choyſe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles obtruded none upon them, by theyre owne Authority, Therefore it ought to be ſo now.</p>
               <p>This Argument when the <hi>authors of the admonition</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; D.

               <p>At laſt, the reformed Churches did, in their publick confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, plead the peoples right in this particular, and in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. A particular inſtance of the Synod, at Middleborough in the yeare 1581, ſhall conclude this diſcourſe of times, where it is thus concluded. <hi>Electio ſit penes Eccleſiam, &amp; fiat per ſuffragium, in Templo publicè,</hi> let the choyſe be in the Church, and be made by voyces publickly in the Church.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20023:36"/> of the conſent of times into an Argument, thus.</p>
               <p>The choyſe of Miniſters, by the free conſent of the people,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Arg.</hi>
                  </note> hath bene conſtantly practiſed by all Churches, in the beſt times ſince the Apoſtles dayes. Therefore it ſhould be ſo now.

               <p>The Antecedent is cleare out of Matth. 16:19. where the Church ſpoken of is the company of beleivers,<note place="margin">

               <p>The Argument is undeniable. For it is in them to chuſe the perſon, whom they will intruſt with ſuch weighty matters, to whom the things themſelves doe primarily belong. Nor is it a ſufficient foundation of that phraſe, that they are given to the Church for her proffit and benefit, unleſſe the Church be able to provide that they be handled by thoſe, by whoſe miniſtry ſhe may be moſt proffited and benefited.</p>

               <p>The Argument is without juſt exception. If not; let ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what materiall be objected againſt it. Will they ſay? The people is rude, and cannot judge; Thus the Phariſes ſayd of old:<note place="margin">

The Anſwerer himſelfe ſayth, <hi>If the complaints be juſt, then is the title juſt, being framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the contents and ſpeciall ſubject of the booke.</hi> And, a litle after. <hi>If this Church be deprived of that liberty and power which Chriſt hath given it &amp;c. then is there cauſe to complaine of the miſerable ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and bondage of this Church.</hi> Theſe be his owne words. What have the complainants or I ſayd more then this? That is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then which cauſeth wearines to him that beareth it. Wearines
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20023:41"/> ariſeth from the diſproportion betweene the faculty and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, hence is paine in the ſubject, and thence are complaints, which are more greivous, as the burthen is more painfull. And, as corporall burthens are made intolerable to the body, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of weight, ſo are inward burthens to the mind, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of aggravating conſiderations. And, in this caſe, the concurrence of many reſpects maketh the burthen, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of, exceeding greivous: as, their love to God, to the Church, to our Nation, to their oppoſed brethen, and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their love to God ſtirreth up indignation in them, when they ſee his ſervants injuryed, and, according to the height of their eſteeme of the men, is the deepenes of their ſenſe of their injuryes. Their injury they expreſſe to be <hi>his rejecting and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them:</hi> their owne eſteeme of the men they declare, in ſtiling them, <hi>the moſt worthy ſervants of God.</hi> Such ſuperlative and exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perant titles the perſons, to whom they are applyed, dare not aſſume to themſelves, acknowledging themſelves to be <hi>unproffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervants,</hi> and not worthy of that high honour to be called the ſervants of ſuch a God: Yet the perſons, who thus deſcribe them, ſhew a great eſteeme of them. To ſee ſuch diſgracefully uſed, not by Ammonites, as Davids ſervants were,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.2.4.5.</note> thorough cauſeles jealouſyes, but by Iſraelites, and to be ſmitten by their fellow ſervants, to the hinderance of the Lords worke, and the furtherance of Sathans projects, is very greivous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their love to the Church ſtirreth up Zeale in them to promove the good thereof, by all poſſible indeavours, both <hi>for their brethren and companions ſake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.</note> 
                  <hi>and becauſe of the houſe of the Lord our God.</hi> Whence their greife is increaſed, if in deavours prove ſucceſſes: eſpecially, when they are denyed thoſe men, whom God ſeemeth to caſt upon them, and the Church unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly deſireth, to the hinderance, of the Churches peace and aedification, and when that is done, not againſt ſome one, but againſt many, nor once only, but often.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. Their love to their Nation and Country ſtirreth up aemulation, &amp; cauſeth much greife &amp; diſcontentment in them at any thing that may reflect reproach or diſgrace upon the ſame,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20023:42"/> as Contentions amongſt them (which by theſe actions are made unavoydable,) will doe, eſpecially in ſuch a place, as Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, where ſo many nations, living in Concord amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and with others, are obſervers, and admirers at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalnes of ſome of ours to their owne countrimen.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. Their love to their rejected and oppoſed brethren ſtirreth up compaſſion in them. For, who can looke upon a ſilly ſheepe ſcratched in a hedge of thornes, whither it fled for ſhelter, without pitty? And, if Iobs complaint is able to affect any tender ſpirit, when he ſayth. <hi>To him ehat is afflicted, pitty ſhould be ſhewed from his brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 6.14.15.</note> 
                  <hi>but my brethren have dealt deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as a brooke</hi> (which is then emptyeſt, when the ſeaſon is hotteſt, and the wearied travayler is in greateſt thirſt,) much more will this ſtirr up Sympathy, in a mercifull heart, to ſee bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, not only, like waters that fayle, but as a violent ſtreame, that threatens to overflow and drowne thoſe, that ſhould be refreſhed, to reject and oppoſe thoſe, that ſhould be received &amp; cheriſhed.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Their love to them ſelves, and to thoſe that depend upon them, ſtirreth up great deſire in them, to injoy thoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which they haue found bleſſed to them: to ſome of them for their effectuall calling to the obedience of Fayth; to others of them, for their buylding up and ſtrengthning in their moſt holy Fayth. Hence, their greife is increaſed. When they ſee themſelves deprived of that, which they haue found ſo good &amp; proffitable. As for his girding Epithites, in the next words, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my perſon, and theire expreſſion, I paſſe it by, pittying his diſtemper. Whereas he ſayth, <hi>that, in the reproofe of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants Mr. D. may, in part, read his owne,</hi> it concerneth me the more ſtrictly and particularly to examine the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that I may ſee how juſtly he reproveth me, being prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in ſome good meaſure, I hope, to beare patiently, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thanckfully, a juſt reproofe, and to hold forth the truth &amp; myne owne innocency againſt unjuſt reproaches, not reſpecting any mans perſon, in diſcharge of my bounden duety. We will therefore exactly obſerve his method, and examine his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, more particularly, and to the ſeverall particulars I reply thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the firſt.] That we all came out of England for one cauſe the Anſwerer acknowledgeth, when the ſayth, <hi>wee all agree in the diſlike of ſome coruptions, againſt which we haue teſtifyed.</hi> For 1. For that cauſe we could not injoy our publick Miniſtry in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. 2. Being denyed that, we thought it our duety to be of what publick uſe we might, for the ſervice of the Church, in any other Country, where God ſhould oppn a dore unto us, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our Countrimen then others. What other particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon any might haue beſids, it might concurr, as a <hi>concauſa,</hi> with others, but that ſtill remaineth the cauſe, which was one, and the ſame to us all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the ſecond.] It is very true and may eaſily be proved. 1. that when an overture hath bene made for any of theſe men, whileſt there was hope, none oppoſed their Election, but ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20023:43"/> many, as were put upon it, expreſſed their deſire of them 2. After the difference betweene this Anſwerer and any of thoſe men, in in ſome opinion, was knowne, I appeale to the Church, whether they deſired not, rather that the Anſwerer would compoſe ſuch differences betweene him and them, by freindly accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or paſſe it by altogether, that they might injoy theſe men, then preſſe things ſo extreamely, to the depriving the Church of them? I am confident, that the greateſt and beſt part of the Church would anſwer, Yea: And I thinck the greateſt and beſt part may well be called the Church, and ſuch a declaration of their affection may be judged a ſufficient proofe of their deſire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the third.] It is to be obſerved, that he doeth not deny, that he oppoſed ſome of theſe men, only he knoweth no reaſon, why it ſhould be wondred at.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For my part, I thinck no man will wonder at it, if by reading his anſwer (as he calleth it) he have but ſome ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into his diſpoſition, as Pythagoras is ſayd to haue into the ſtature and ſtrength of Hercules his body, by the meaſure of his foote.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe thoſe men are, in ſome few opinions, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite each to other. Will that juſtify his oppoſing and rejecting them? Let him draw his argument into forme of a Syllogiſme, and it will prove a mere Sophiſme, and to labour of an aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, in the word <hi>oppoſite &amp; oppoſe,</hi> which, in the <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> noateth difference in judgement only (which may ſtand with perſonall concord) in the <hi>conſequent,</hi> it ſignifyeth perſonall oppoſition, and ſo there be 4 termes in it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His wholl argument is grounded upon a falſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. For he ſuppoſeth, that oppoſition againſt the perſon muſt neceſſarily, or may warrantably follow all difference in judgement. The contrary whereof is moſt true.<note place="margin">Synodal Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drecht. Rem: Sent: ſuae declarat. P. 5.</note> When the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> odiouſly exaggerated, and objected againſt the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> their different opinions, about the object of Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, Dr. Twiſſe learnedly, and judiciouſly wipeth of this aſperſion, and therein anſwereth the ground of this Argument, by ſhewing the perſonall agreement and love betweene thoſe men that ſo differed, and inſtanceth in Calvin, Beza, Iunius and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20023:44"/> Piſcator,<note place="margin">Vindiciae gratiae Digr. <hi>1.</hi> Sect. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> each of which had his ſeverall tenet, differing from the other, and Piſcator ſeemed to differ from them all, and yet his high eſteeme of them all is manifeſt, 1, of Iunius, in his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia upon the old teſtament, 2, of Beza, in his Scholia upon the New teſtament, 3, of Calvin, in his aphoriſmes gathered out of Calvins inſtitutions. 2. in the ſweet harmony &amp; conſent of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Fourthly, The premiſes being conſidered, it is to be wondred at, that he oppoſeth theſe men &amp; rejecteth them, upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Seing. 1. theſe men, in unfeigned brotherly love, tender the eſteeme one of another, and would account it their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines that they might live in one Church together, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe pretended differences betweene them, 2, and all godly men order themſelves by that Apoſtolicall Canon, in ſuch caſes,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwyſe minded, God ſhall reveale even this unto you. Nevertheles, where to we have already attayned, let us walke by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing.</hi> 3. And it is the more to be wondred at, ſeeing the men, whom he is ſayd to reject and oppoſe, are knowne to be of ſound judgment, godly, peaceble, free from haereſy, and Schyſme, and therefore not to be rejected and oppoſed, for ſuch points, wherein men may differ, without violation of love and peace, or danger of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others. 4. And this addeth to the cauſe of wonder, that theſe men (eſpicially the 2. that are firſt mentioned, and have bene moſt oppoſed,) have offered to carry the matter ſo, if he would joyne with them therein, as none ſhould take notice of any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene them. Laſtly, this exceedingly increaſeth the wonder; becauſe, unleſſe men will yeeld ſo much favour each to other, in ſome Difference of opinions, as the Church, and ſome of thoſe Miniſters, have deſired of the Anſwerer, a diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, not only of Churches, but of humaine Societyes alſo, muſt neceſſarily follow, and not only, not 2. Miniſters, but, not 2. men ſhould live together, which were to put off even huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelfe.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:20023:44"/>
               <p>Fiftly, Are theſe men oppoſites each to other? The good Lord diſcover to him, in mercy, the evill of that principle in his owne ſpirit, from whence theſe diſcoveryes of other mens diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences flowed! For. 1, Who called him to publiſh to the world ſuch mens private differences, there being neither need, nor good uſe of it, in this place? was not this in part propheſyed of, to be in the laſt dayes and perilous times, that men ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">

To what end doeth this paſſage tend, but to cauſe ſtrife and contention betweene ſo many of theſe as are alive (&amp; the Apoſtle Iames<note place="margin">Iames 3.14.15.</note> telleth us from whence <hi>this wiſdom deſcendeth</hi>) and to blemiſh both the living and the dead, by leaving them under the cenſure, or ſuſpition of Errour.

What event, or iſſue of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable diſcoveries can be expected, but ſcandall? Hence Atheiſts, Libertines, profane perſons caſt off all care of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yea hence all Haereticks and Sectaries are hardned againſt the Orthodox, becauſe they agree not among themſelves. What rule is here by tranſgreſſed I need not tell the Anſwerer.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, was it an underhand courſe, for which I was to be complained of, for want of ſincere and plaine dealing, that I wrote downe, only for the helpe of myne owne memory, the talke that paſſed betweene him and me, about that queſtion? Was this done by me like a deceitfull Notary? And doth it argue me to be farr from honeſt and ingenuous dealing, as he affirmeth? What ſhall be thought of him then, who doth not noate, for his owne ſecret uſe, but print to the view of all men, not conferences about queſtions betweene him and them, but perſonall differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces betweene them, not only without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or knowledge, but alſo injuriouſly and untruely, not being compelled thereunto, but needleſly, and without provocation?</p>

                  </label> When he ſayth, we are oppoſite, I hope, he meaneth not in our affections: If he doe; he is much deceived, or elſe I am much deceived in myne owne heart, which knoweth, that I account him a Godly, learned, faythfull, worthy preacher of the Goſpel, in his fellowſhip with Chriſtians ſingularly proffitable, very peaceable in his converſation towards all, of a ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and unreproveable life. In a word, ſuch an one, as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam had bene happy, if it might have injoyed him, and therefore is the more intolerably injuryed, in being deprived of him. What is it then? We are oppoſite each to other, in our opinions, in thoſe 3. points. It were good that all ambiguity were removed, in expreſſions of this kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oppoſition in opinions is the fight of 2. propoſitions which conſiſt of the ſame ſubject, and praedicate: and this fight is, either in their quality alone, or in their quantity alone, or in both together. Now, which of thoſe wayes Mr. H. and I were oppoſite the Anſwerer ſhould have ſhewen, if he would have diſcovered the extent of our difference, which, becauſe he hath neglected, the Reader doth not well know what to judge in this matter. Wherefore, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all miſtake, I muſt profeſſe, that, upon a ſerious review of the copy of that wrighting of queſtions and anſwers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, I find ſome difference betweene the Anſwerers report of paſſages, which he made to me, and Mr. Hooker his owne expreſſion of his judgment, in that manu-ſcript: and therefore, in the 2. former points rightly underſtood, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his true meaning, as may be eaſily and clearely gathered out of his owne words, I fully agree with him. As for the third, I doe reverence his judgment in that which is not fully cleare to me, and doe profeſſe ingenuouſly, that I rather ſuſpect myne owne apprehenſion, then his judgment, in that wherein we ſeeme to differ. Now let the Reader judge; whether this prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended difference betweene us be worthy to be publiſhed, in this manner.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Be it ſo: but, Firſt, Let it be proved that it is ſo in theſe perſons: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                  </label> wherein the Anſwerer is to prove 3 things. 1. That the things charged upon theſe perſons are offences and errours. 2. That they are eminent ones. 3. That they are juſt cauſe of oppoſing and refuſing ſuch eminent men, as unfitt for his Congregation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let theſe things be proved by Scripture, For all men are apt, 1, to err, and to be in loue with their errours, 2, to be harſh and unadviſed in their judgement of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt, Men are apt to err, &amp; to be in loue with their errours.<note place="margin">Chameron of popiſh praejudices, Cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> The cauſe of which miſcheife is the perverſenes of their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which oftentimes ſo overheate &amp; diſtemper the heart, that, out of it, as it were, exhaling thick and black vapours, upon the underſtanding, they, either diſturbe our judgments, or altogether dull our apprehenſions. In which reſpect, an heart chafed with paſſion, leaveth us in a worſe caſe, then peircing ſmokes doe the eyes which bereaue us of our bodily ſight: For they, ſeing nothing, can not be deluded by lying apparitions, but by theſe, though the light of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be dimmed, yea extinguiſhed, yet there remaines a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous conceit of our owne cleare ſight, and reall compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the truth: whence it is, that man, compaſſed about with thick darkenes, confidently imagineth that he walketh in the ſun-ſhine, and he is ſtrongly conceited, that he hath then faſt hold of the truth, when he huggeth an abſurd ridiculous fable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, from the ſame cauſe it is, that men are harſh, and raſh in their cenſures of others, who diſſent from thoſe tenets, for the defence whereof they are ingaged. And, as men, that looke thorough a coloured glaſſe, thinck that all the things they ſee, thorough it, are of the ſame colour with the glaſſe, ſo they, judging of mens opinions, by the errour of their owne diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered fancyes, cry out, <hi>Errours, Errours</hi> many times cauſeleſly.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23</note> Thus the Panymes, puffed up with a conceit of their owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, accounted the doctrines of the chriſtian Religion, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes. And, as their paſſions increaſe, ſo their cenſures will

               <p>Thirdly. To prevent a ſcandall againſt theſe men, and their Tenets, let the Reader know, that the ſuſpition of falſity is a calumny ordinary to trueth, yet trueth is not to be diſliked for ſuch imputations, under which it is often hid, as admirable beauty, under a maſke, or as a ſolid ſparckling diamond, under ſome diſcolourment. But, as a rich Diamond ſuſpected of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardy ſhould be brought to the touchſtone and admitted to a tryall; ſo let trueth, being ſuſpected, be examined, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, upon mere ſurmiſes.</p>

                  </label> Firſt, This anſwer is but a mere diverſion of the Reader from the true queſtion betweene the Anſwerer, and the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. They complaine of him for rejecting and oppoſing thoſe men, whom, with one conſent, the Church deſired: not, of not giving his voyce for their calling, nor of his declaring what he judgeth beſt for the Church, nor of his bringing the matter to the Claſſis, being ſimply conſidered, but of his rejecting theſe men, and oppoſing them, ſo farr, as to deprive the Church of them. To this the Anſwerer anſwereth juſt nothing in his owne defenſe, and to convince the Complainants of untrueth.</p>
               <p>Secondly that which he acknowledgeth himſelfe to haue done, leaveth him under the guilt of that ſinne which they charge u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him. For, 1, his oppoſing and rejecting of theſe men, whom the Church deſired, was unjuſt, ſeing they held no opinions, which, by warrant of the Scripture, make them uncapable of being called to his Church. 2. His manner of proceeding was diſorderly, in carrying the matter to the Claſſis, before he had declared to the Church the aequity of his refuſing theſe men, by the Scriptures. 3. Is a mere pretence that things were unjuſtly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20023:47"/> carryed, and ſwayed againſt him, in the Church, or Conſiſtory, a ſufficient ground of an appeale to the Claſſis, as to <hi>an higher lawfull judicatory;</hi> that ſo he may ſway them, according to his owne will, without a rule, or to other mens cuſtoms, without a word? If this be not to deprive the Church of their liberty and power, in the free choyſe of their Paſtor, let the Reader judge. The wholl ſhall be reſolved into a Syllogiſme.</p>
               <p>He that, without juſt and ſufficient cauſe, oppoſed and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the calling of theſe perſons inſtanced, whom the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, ſinned, in ſo doing.</p>
               <p>But the Anſwerer, without juſt and ſufficient cauſe, oppoſed and hindered the calling of thoſe perſons, whom the Church deſired.</p>
               <p>Therefore in ſo oppoſing, he ſinned.</p>
               <p>Which propoſition will he deny? The firſt? He cannot.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 22: Anſ. 8.</note> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath acknowledged it to be a ſinne, <hi>yea an heynous crime, &amp; no leſſe then Sacriledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will he deny the ſecond propoſition, or the Aſſumption? He cannot. For, did not the Church deſire theſe men? It hath bene proved, in Reply to his ſecond anſwer, in this Section. If he ſay; not all of them: let him name which of them they did not deſire, which I belieue he cannot doe. But if he could; it will not helpe him. For, if it be true of 2, or of any one, he is guilty of ſinne by refuſing them, in the caſe propounded. Will he deny, that he oppoſed, and hindred the calling of them? Himſelfe acknowledgeth it, in the 3 and 4 anſwer of this Section, and more at large &amp; expreſſely in the 6 anſwer, in the reply where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Reader ſhall find alſo that it was done, without juſt and ſufficient cauſe. But that he may be more fully convinced of ſinne herein, thus I argue. He that doth an injury, ſinneth. But the Anſwerer, in thus oppoſing theſe men, doeth an injury. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Anſwerer, in ſo doing, ſinneth,</p>
               <p>The Major, or firſt propoſition is cleare of it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Injuria eſt violatio juris 1. Ioh. 3.4.</note> for every injury is a tranſgeſſion of the Law.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption, or ſecond propoſition, is, that the Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, in thus oppoſing theſe men, doeth an injury. This I will
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20023:48"/> prove by ſhewing that, ſo to doe is againſt, both the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the poſitiue Law.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is againſt the law of Nature, which conſiſteth of practicall principles, which men know they ought to doe, or to avoyd, by the light of nature. Amongſt which this is one. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you would,</hi>

                  <hi>that men ſhould doe unto you, doe ye even ſo to them.</hi> Now, I demand, would the Anſwerer be upbrayded with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and traduced as erronious, before ſtrangers, before a publick Congregation, before a Claſſis of Reverend Miniſters, yea, before the wholl world, in print, and that, by a brother fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for learning and miniſteriall abilityes, and that without proofe? Would he thinck himſelfe aequally dealt withall, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould oppoſe and reject him, as unfit for a place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he is called by the Church, without ſufficient cauſe? If not; let him reflect upon his owne actions, and conſider, whether he be not guilty of an injury,<note place="margin">Lact: in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. <hi>C. 3.</hi>
                  </note> which an heathen man, ſuch as Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Severus would not willingly be guylty of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the poſitiue Law, or the law of God revealed in Scriptures is violated by it, many wayes. For it is a threefold injury, viz, againſt the men, againſt the Church, and againſt the Claſſis. 1. It is an injury to the men, whom he rejected, whom he traduced to the Church, and to the Claſſis, and now in print, as unfit for that place, whereby he is guilty of detraction and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: which injury will appeare to be the greater, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1, the qualityes and condition of the men, whoſe names are mentioned, 2. his manner of doing it, viz: not raſhly, but upon deliberation, not ſparingly, but with odious intimations of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent offences, and errours, not ſecretly, but in publick, and in print, not truely, but untruely and ſlanderouſly. 3. the dangerous conſequences, and events of it. For 1. the men thus reproached are expoſed to the cenſure of all men. 2. their enimyes have ſome pretence, whereupon to juſtify their unjuſt oppoſing them, and ſo are hardened in ſinne. 3. a blow and wound is given to the authority of their Miniſtry, in the hearts of ſo many as aſcribe any thing to his teſtimony againſt ſuch men, which may endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the ſoules of many.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20023:48"/> For, 1, It is a deluding of them, by pretending that he had juſt cauſe of oppoſing and rejecting thoſe men, when he had not. 2. It is a defrauding of them of that power and liberty, which Chriſt hath given them (as himſelfe confeſſeth) in the free choyſe of their Paſtor, under pretence of ſeeking the adviſe of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis: himſelfe calleth this ſinne <hi>Sacriledge.</hi> 3. It is a ſlander of them to ſay that matters are unjuſtly ſwayed againſt him in the Church, or Conſiſtory, when they deſire only ſuch men as theſe are, againſt whom himſelfe hath alleadged no objection of weight ſufficient to keepe them out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is an injury to the Claſſis: yea a threefold injury alſo. 1. It is a diſturbing them and diſtracting them from better imployments, to attend needles quarells. 2. It is a miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them, both concerning theſe Miniſters, and his Church and Conſiſtory, whereby, through too much credulity, they are unjuſtly praejudiced againſt the innocent. 3. It is a miſingaging them, by ſollicitations, and pretences, to be parties with him, in an injury. But the wrong to himſelfe is the greateſt of all, which I pray God, by his ſpirit, to convince him of! without which he will goe on ſtill to boaſt of a falſe peace.</p>

               <p>This being the manner of proceeding in the Claſſis, with a

               <p>If, upon inquiry, it ſhall appeare, that the matter was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their judgment by the Church, and that only ſome few of the Miniſters, or all, or moſt of them, without ſhewing the aequity of their ſentence by the Scriptures, thus judged, &amp; without hearing what Mr. H. could ſay in defence of his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then gave it under their hands, to ſubject the Church to theyre determination, and the Anſwerer procured this to be done, and afterwards preſſed it upon the Church, to keepe out Mr. H. let the Reader judge whether this be not a manifeſt depriving of the Church of that liberty and power which Chriſt hath given it, as himſelfe acknowledgeth, in the free choyſe of theyre Paſtor?

For may not any thing he held ſtand with the doctrine contained in the Catechiſme, Confeſſion, and Synodicall explication thereof? And doeth the Synod require any more of him, that is to be admitted to any Church in theſe countryes? I am confident, that this caſe would beare a review, &amp; that a Nationall Synod would not juſtify the deputyes for that provinciall Synod, nor the deputyes juſtify that Claſſis, nor the Claſſis approve of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers dealing in this buiſenes, if it were more thoroughly examined.</p>

               <p>For this man] his workes doe, in part, ſhew his worth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which a judicious cenſurer, though differing from him in judgement about the Hierarthy, teſtifyed, that they <hi>are as full of learning as an egg is full of meate.</hi> His workes which I haue ſeene are. 1. a treatiſe againſt the Croſſe 2. <hi>De deſcenſu Chriſti ad inferos.</hi> 3. <hi>De Politia Eccleſiaſtica.</hi> One would haue thought that Holland ſhould have eſteemed the opportunity of ſetling ſuch an one amongſt them an unvaluable beſſing.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20023:52"/> what could they object againſt him, which the Anſwerer could not have anſwered? Did they ſuſpect him of inclining to Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme?

But, that it may appeare, they erred, who diſliked it, and, that all may be ſatiſfyed, concerning Dr. Ames his removeall from Franeker to Rotterdam, I will breifely relate the ſtory of it, from the teſtimony of one, who was an eye and eare-witnes, and, upon knowledge, wrote to me the words following.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1. At his firſt comming to Franeker, he found things in ſuch a frame in, the Vniverſity, that he thought of departing thence before he was ſetled.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2. Vpon the reformation made by the wiſe and religious care of ſome few intereſted in the government of that Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, he had ſome more hope of content, and he continued ſuffering ſo much, the firſt yeare, that, had he not had a greater ſtrength then his owne to ſupport him, he had not bene able to have borne it, and he lived there, his wholl time, in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall oppoſition, and ſuffering. So that, in that 12 yeares, he indured more,</q> I thinck, then Mr. P. hath in his life.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>3. For the place; though it may, and doth agree with ſome bodies, yet it did not agree with him, the ayre being very ſharpe in winter, which ſo wraught upon him every yeare, that, towards the end of winter, he was ever ſo troubled with ſtoppings and ſhortnes of breath, that he could ſcarſely goe a flight ſhot, without reſting; and would alwayes ſay. <hi>If I can hold out this winter, If I can hold out this winter, &amp;c.</hi> I thinck, he had done well, for his owne health, if he had come away ſome yeares before.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <q>4. For his comming from Franeker. 1. he did it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great counſail and deliberation, Indeed, contrary to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20023:57"/> deſire of ſome of the States of Frieſland, which truely deſired the good of the Academy, yet could not, being the weaker party, defend him in his righteous cauſe, wherein he was left alone, which made him the more confident, that God did call him thence, all his company, which were of the beſt party, being plucked away from thence wonderfully, which went very neare him, as, the Profeſſour of Hebrew, whoſe name was Amama, a worthy man, in his place, a right honeſt man, whom the Lord tooke away being yong, and of a very healthfull conſtitution: ſhortly after, the Logick Profeſſour, a yong likely man, and one of that party, died alſo. Then another, which was Profeſſour of Divinity, a worthy and an holy man, as any they have in that Country, who, ſeing how all things went, and having a call to Lewerden, which is the head towne of that County, left his Profeſſourſhip and tooke that paſtorall charge. There were one or two more, who, ſeing how things went, ranne with the ſtreame, and left him alone to ſtrive againſt it, wherein finding his labour in vaine, and no hope of redreſſe, this made his being there uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and him more ready to looke out to Rotterdam being offered, where he thought he might doe much good, both by his Miniſtry, unto which his owne heart did much incline him, and his Academicall imployments, by which he thought he might doe as much good at Rotterdam, as at Franeker, moſt good he did there being private: other incouragements alſo he had for his change, as 1. the proffitable miniſtry which he hoped there to injoy, the want of which did not a litle trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him. 2. the covenant and government of that Church, which he did approve of, and hoped to be a meanes to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh. 3. the ſociety of good people, which he promiſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there, more then he could poſſibly obtaine in Franeker, there being not one of our Nation, and few of the other to be found.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <q>5. And, for motives. 1. his owne inclination, upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd grounds. 2. the Church of Rotterdam its call, againe, and againe renued, with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pet. great deſire, a long time mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and the deſire of ſome of the Burgomaſters. 3. his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20023:57"/> freinds, whom he acquainted with the buiſenes, they perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, as being a thing that might redound much to his health, &amp; comfort, telling him that many would come to Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam to be helped in theyre ſtudies by him, that would not come to Frieſland, and whereas one brought ſome reaſons againſt it, he ſoone anſwered and ſatiſfyed him.</q> By which nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it ſeemeth that the learned men, who diſliked it, concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led theyre judgments from him, if there were any ſuch. And the Anſwerer himſelfe cannot well be excuſed, if he diſliked it, that he hid his diſlike that time, and now publiſheth it, after his death, to the world. To winde up all in a few words. 1. Jf things continued in ſo ill a ſtate at Franeker, and there was no hope of reformation. 2. Jf the climate did ſo ill agree with his body. 3. If his owne heart, upon the motives formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was ſtrongly inclined for Rotterdam. 4. If all his freinds, upon good grounds, adviſed him to it, and thoſe that ſpake with him, being of a different opinion, were ſatiſfyed with his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 5. If the Church and Commonwealth ſhould have the ſame fruite of his Academicall exerciſes at Rotterdam, which they had at Franeker, &amp; with advantage of a place more convenient for Students, &amp; of his miniſteriall imployments ſuper-added to the former; I pray the Reader to judge, whether D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ames his removeall from Franeker, deſerve a diſliking cenſure from lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men. Thus having indeavoured to ſcatter the myſt, which elſe might have hindred the ſhining forth of this eminent light, we leave him in the bleſſed injoyment of that inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble light, whereunto he was tranſlated by death above two years ſince. He died in Rotterdam, a litle before I came into theſe countryes, and was buried, on the 14 day of November 1633. New ſtile. We now proceed to the third worthy, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, and to examine what he ſayth concerning him.</p>
               <p>Two reaſons are pretended by the Anſwerer againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, Forbes,<note place="margin">Anſ. <hi>5</hi> A defence of Mr. Forbes.</note> for the juſtifying of his refuſing him to be his Collea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue. 1. <hi>His differing from him in judgment about the Declinatour, or appeale</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>His refuſall of referring that difference to an hearing of Miniſters.</hi> And thence he proceedeth, in the third place, to ſhew the iſſue of this difference, and Mr. F. refuſall to referr it,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20023:58"/> which was, that, <hi>not only he, but all the Elders, with one conſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to proceed in the calling of him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To the firſt.] Herein may be noated. 1. The Anſwerers unaequall dealing in publiſhing to the world theſe particulars againſt Mr. F. which, by his owne confeſſion, were, at leaſt 24 yeares paſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 13.</note> whereas he blameth the Complainants for unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable admonition, in that they complaine now of matters done above 20 yeares agone, about Mr. Parker and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Forbes. Was it unſeaſonable in them, and is it not ſo in him? Nor will it helpe, that he ſay, they compell him to it, ſeing in the very next inſtance (viz ſpeaking of Mr. Peters) he ſayth. <hi>I thinck it needles to give a reaſon here, why I gave not my voyce for him.</hi> Why might not this anſwer as well have ſerved in the former inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? 2. His policy is to be noated, in this paſſage, in his urging that appeale as a meane to keepe out M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Forbes, well knowing that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Forbes would not now paſſe from that, for procuring a Miniſtry in Amſterdam, for the which he had formerly taken his life in his hand, and, at that inſtant, indured baniſhment. 3. His diſparadging of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Forbes his judgment, when he ſayth, <hi>he ſaught to maintayne his appeale,</hi> inſinuating thereby an indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, without ability.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To the ſecond.] 1. Any man of underſtanding and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will conclude that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Forbes his refufall of entring into that diſpute with the Anſwerer, is not to be imputed to his feare of the Anſwerers weapons or ſtrength (eſpecially the caſe being ſuch, wherein M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. F. had bene as well ſifted before, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer could ſift him) but to his great wiſdome &amp; modeſty who hath alwayes manifeſted that duetifull reſpect to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, never to ſtand to the defence of any thing diſpleaſing to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>, but when, and where conſcience did urge him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he have entred into that debate, without ſome overture of too much forwardnes for, and deſire of that ſtation, from which his ſpirit was very averſe. 2. it ſeemeth not to be without too much ſelfe-confidence, that he undertooke <hi>to ſhew Mr. F. the unlawfullnes of that appeale.</hi> The wholl councell of Scotland (conſiſting of wiſe and honourable perſons) with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20023:58"/> others, as well verſed in the lawes and conſtitutions, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, and civill of Scotland, as the Anſwerer, did theyre indeavour to make Mr. F. and his aſſociats to underſtand the unlawfullnes of it, and yet they could not ſee it, but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer will preſently ſhew it them.</p>
               <p>To the third.] That both <hi>he and the Elders, with one conſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to proceed in the calling of Mr. F. upon his refuſall to give them ſatiſfaction.]</hi> A refuſall ſuppoſeth a petition, the Anſwerer ſhould have ſhewen who was the petitioner. 1 was it Mr. Forbes? This ſeemeth to be intimated. But they that knew M. Forbes, knew him to be a man of no ſuch meane ſpirit, as to petition, or ſeeke to be the Anſwerers Colleague. 2. were the members of the Church the petitioners, or motioners for his call? and was theyr requeſt fruſtrated, upon this ground? Then theyre complaint ſeemeth to be juſt, in that they were deprived of him, for ſuch a cauſe. For what is a difference about things done in Scotland (and which are proper and peculiar to the cognition of that State) to the Church in Amſterdam? what Canon of any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Synod? what order of any Claſſis? what Cuſtom of any Church in Holland is violated, by Mr. Forbes his opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Declinatour?</hi> Which injury, both to them and him, is the greater, ſeing, notwithſtanding that, he was intertayned, &amp; ſetled in an Engliſh Church, and (which is more to this purpoſe) with the Engliſh Merchants, amongſt whom he lived, paynfully diſcharging the office of a Paſtor, above 20 yeares, to the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar content of the Company, &amp; not without his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> of Great Brittaine &amp;c. King Iames, of famous memory, his approbation, as, to the prayſe of his Royall clemency, appeared in a meſſage ſent by him to the Company. For him God provided mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But the Church in Amſterdam, was, by this meane, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of a man of eminent worth, in the injoyment of the fruits of whoſe learning, judgement, wiſdom, amiable ſpirit, and other exellent properties, and indowments, all places, where he hath lived, thought themſelves happy, accounting him a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all indowments, which are requiſite, not onely for a miniſter to any Church, but alſo for a publike inſtrument, upon great occaſions, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon affaires of many Churches, to ſtand
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20023:59"/> before princes. What eſteeme he had in Scotland, appeared by theyr imploying of him in publick ſervices, &amp; thoſe of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. How he was accepted in Swede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whither he travayled, after his baniſhment, was manifeſt, beſides other inſtances, in the great favour ſhewed him, and honourable proffer made to him, by that Mirrour of Princes, the laſt King of Sweden, a litle before his death. How the Company of Merchants, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed him ſo many yeares, affected him, is evident in the annuall exhibition which they have conferred upon his widow, as a teſtimony of theyr high eſteeme of him, theyr deceaſed Paſtor, whom it pleaſed God to call hence, where in <hi>ter <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eer</hi> he finiſhed his courſe, &amp; was freed from all the troubles of his pilgrimage, to injoy <hi>that crowne of righteouſnes which is layd up for thoſe that have faught a good fight,</hi> he died on the 5 day of Auguſt, old ſtile, and was buryed, on the 9 day Anno 1634.</p>
               <p>In the ſixt place, he dealeth with Mr. Peters, or rather decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the anſwer of theyr complaint, in that particular. Had he done ſo in all the reſt, he had eaſed me of all this labour and trouble, &amp; might have ſeemed to others more free from blame then he is, or now can rationally be judged to be.</p>

Nor is an intereſt in wiſe and godly men, an infallible ſigne of upright walking. Indeed intereſt in God is a ſigne of uprightnes, as in Noah, Abraham, Iob, Moſes, Samuell, David &amp;c. Becauſe the Lord ſearcheth the heart, and knoweth our thoughts afarre off: but it is not ſo in mens acceptance, who, judging by the outward appearance, are often deceived and may be deluded by falſe pretences. Was not David a wiſe King? And yet Ziba abuſed his intereſt in him, and, by miſinforming him, cauſed him to doe an iniury to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſeth. The Church, to whom Iohn the Divine wrote, was not deſtitute of wiſe men, and of men able to judge: yet Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes ſo farr abuſed his intereſt in them, as the Apoſtle deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9.10.</note> ſaying. <hi>I wrote unto the Church, but Diotrephes that loveth to have the preheminence amongſt them, received us not, wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds, which he doeth, prating againſt us with malicious words, and not content therewith, neither doeth he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and caſteth them out of the Church.</hi> Boath thoſe had an intereſt: the one in the Magiſtrate, the other in the Church, which they abuſed.

               <p>To the ſixth and ſeventh,] where he ſheweth what order the Magiſtrates ſet downe, about <hi>having one that can ſpeake Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtory which here he relateth, cleareth three points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is no ſlander, when they ſay, that none of our Nation, that come immediatly from England, though never ſo fit and able, ſhall be admitted, but they muſt be forced to take one that can ſpeake Dutch. Himſelfe in relating the ſtory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth this to be no ſlander, but a trueth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is no ſlander, when they complaine of him as guilty of this injury. For, beſides what he hath done towards the procuring of this, it is evident, that he was ſo farr from
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20023:60"/> pleading, or ſtirring up the Elders to joyne with him, in peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the altering of this order, as that he pleadeth for it, though, they ſay, it is to the unſpeakeakle injury and greife of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is no ſlander, that they complaine of the Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for this, and not of the Magiſtrate, ſeing he urgeth it more vehemently then they ſeeme to doe. For they propound it as a matter only, in ſome reſpects, convenient, that the Engliſh prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſpeake Dutch, but he preſſeth it as neceſſary. The former appeareth three wayes. 1. in that caution which they give <hi>[If it were poſſible]</hi> wherein I ſuppoſe, they meane, with the conſent and approbation of the Church: for otherwiſe, if they would obtrude one upom them, they need not put in that proviſo. 2. In the reaſons, which they give for that theyre deſire, which doe imply only an expediency, viz, <hi>that he may debate matters with the Claſſis, and treate with the Magiſtrate, on the Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, as occaſion ſhall require,</hi> which a man may doe, by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the language after he is ſetled, though he have no Dutch before. 3. Jn theyre indulgence to me, which the Anſwerer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, in ſayng, that <hi>they were content to diſpenſe with my want of the Dutch language,</hi> which ſheweth that they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it but an expediency, with which they would diſpenſe, in a caſe of neceſſity. The latter (viz,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 31.6.</note> that the Anſwerer preſſeth it as a matter neceſſary) appeareth in his owne words, when he ſayth, <hi>that a miniſter called to this place which can not ſpeake Dutch, is, in great meaſure, no better then a Dumbe Miniſter, in reſpect of one ſpeciall worke of his calling, which is to give adviſe &amp;c. In the Claſſis.</hi> If, to ſit in the Dutch Claſſis &amp;c. Be one ſpeciall worke of the Engliſh Miniſters calling, then indeed his ability to ſpeake Dutch, is a neceſſary requiſite, without which he is but a dumb miniſter. But how will this be proved? For 1. Paul in his Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to Timothy and Titus and in the reſt of his Epiſtles, ſpeaketh nothing of this property or duety, nor is it any where elſe in Scripture revealed to be neceſſary, how then is it <hi>a ſpeciall worke of his calling?</hi> 2. The Magiſtrates doe not preſſe this ſitting in the Dutch Claſſis, upon the Engliſh preachers in other townes in Holland. How commeth it to be ſo ſpeciall a worke of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20023:61"/> calling <hi>in Amſterdam?</hi> 3. This is not urged as a ſpeciall worke of a miniſters calling to the French &amp; walloon Churches in that Citty; How comes it to be ſo to the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> 4. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer did not account it a ſpeciall worke of his calling to ſit in the <hi>Dutch Claſſis,</hi> a good while after his comming to Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, when he laboured to ſet up an <hi>Engliſh Claſſis;</hi> though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he oppoſed the ſame thing, when it tooke effect by Mr. Forbes his labour. How comes it now to be a ſpeciall worke of his calling, which then was not? <hi>5.</hi> The Anſwerer hath bene heard to ſay, that he commeth ſometimes from the Claſſis grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved &amp; troubled in his mind, becauſe, when weighty matters are debated, he cannot ſufficiently expreſſe his mind in Dutch. And well may it greive him to ſupply the place of a Paſtor there, if he find him ſelfe unable to performe one ſpeciall worke of his calling. To wind up all. Seing the Anſwerer maketh that an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worke of the Miniſters calling to his Church in Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, which God doeth not make ſo, in any place of Scripture, nor the Magiſtrates doe make ſo, neither there, to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor, in other Cityes, to other Engliſh Churches, and ſeing, by that pretence, they are deprived of many worthy men, which they might have injoyed (had not this bene ſo inſiſted upon by him) and ſeing the Anſwerer doth urge it more ſtrictly, then the Magiſtrates (they propounding it, but as a matter of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, but he preſſing it, as a matter of neceſſity) haue not the members juſt cauſe to complaine of this as a greivance? Nor will this free him from blame, that he is but one, and claymeth but one voyce, ſeing he hindreth, that what agreeth not with his mind, can not be ended in the Church, but is carryed to the Claſſis, where he can ſtrengthen himſelfe, by helpe of thoſe whom he gayneth to his party, by rayſing cauſeles ſuſpitions of ſome factions, or Shyſmaticall intentions in his people, or in the Conſiſtory, which they receive from him, and report to the Magiſtrates, who, at theyre intreaty, interpoſe to prevent ſome imagined diſtractions, which may fall in the Engliſh Church: whereas, if they had rightly bene informed of the wholl truth, they would have ſeene the requeſt of the Church to be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20023:61"/> and juſt, and the oppoſition made againſt it to be injurious, and blameworthy.</p>

                  </label> I am ſo farr from juſtifying any thing done or ſpoken amiſſe, even by my freinds, that this Anſwerer intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it to be a <hi>juſt reward of Mr. B. inordinate affection to me,</hi> that I cenſure the printing of that pamphlet to be an injury. That which I did in the ſimplicity, and uprightnes of my heart, not knowing that Mr. B. was the publiſher, in way of witnes bearing to the truth, and in favour of him, he wreſteth and perverteth to contrary ends. This dealing of his, in that particular, may make me wary of uttering my thoughts, in a like caſe, when another lyeth to watch and catch all advantages againſt me and them. Therefore what I account amiſſe in this expreſſion, on theyr part, I will conceale, and alſo paſſe by the diſtemper of his ſpirit, which, upon this occaſion, venteth it ſelfe. The comparing of the reply to the former Section and this, will giue ſome light, whereby the Reader may diſcerne, 1. whether that which they have diſliked, and complained of, be not a juſt greivance, 2. whether, in that caſe, ſuch an expreſſion deſerve ſo heavy a cenſure. Here he inſtanceth in three perſons ſent for by him, and nameth but one of them, viz <hi>Mr. Balmford,</hi> whom he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth in the firſt place. In the paſſages concerning him I noate three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Vpon a third and fourth review,<note place="margin">A defence of Mr. Balmford,</note> I wondred why ſo litle was ſayd by the Anſwerer in the juſt acknowledgment of Mr, B. ſufficiency, eſpecially ſeing the next, whoſe name he concealeth, is honoured by him with the prayſe of <hi>ſpeciall gifts of learning,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20023:62"/> piety, and utterance,</hi> &amp; the third, whoſe name he alſo ſuppreſſeth, is ſtiled <hi>a man of ſpeciall noate for his learning, and labours in the Church of God.</hi> But, when I conſider the men, (him, upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and them by geſſe, and report of others) I ſeeme to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the cauſe of it, which was, not that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford was inferiour to either of thoſe men, in the deſart of ſuch attributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s but that, if he had freely done him right, in ſo publick a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof, it might have reflected more honour upon him then he can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent ſhould be devolved upon one, whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did at all differ from his, and agree with his oppoſites, as, he accounteth them, in the point controverted betweene us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet, when it may ſerve for a ſtaffe, wherewith to beate the Complainants, he addeth thus much. <hi>His great unfitnes is theyre great ſlander, that avouch it, unles they could prove it.]</hi> Neither himſelfe nor they will be ever able to prove M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. unfit for that Church, but both he and they might have bleſſed God, with much thanckfullnes, for ſuch a mercy, if they had injoyed him. And certainely it will be found worthy to be called <hi>a great ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> if any ſhall impute <hi>great unfitnes</hi> to him. The place where he hath diverſe yeares executed his paſtorall function, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, painfully, proffitably and with good acceptance, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably before Amſterdam, both in the eminency of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours, and in theyre ability to judge of his ſufficiency: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved approbation of him, and affection to him ſo frequently expreſſed, on all fitting occaſions, by all ſorts of hearers, both reſorting thither, and reſiding there, are in ſtead of letters of recommondation, to ſtop the mouths of any that ſhall muſſitate or whiſper any ſuch diſparadging intimations, and to convince them of <hi>great ſlander.</hi> But now the queſtion will be, at whoſe dore the ſlander muſt be layd? For the Complainants refuſe to father it, and doe retort the accuſation of a <hi>great ſlander</hi> upon the Anſwerer himſelfe, and profeſſe the great unfitnes, which they meant, was intended by them concerning others, partly, in reſpect of the language, and they name ſeverall men againſt whom they except in that reſpect, whom they could not wel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, through ſome defect of the Engliſh tongue, or theyre manner of pronouncing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> partly; in reſpect of yeares, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20023:62"/> for ſuch a worke, whereof ſome other inſtances are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by them. But of boath theſe inſufficiencyes they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford, and blame the Anſwerer that he hath ſo needleſly brought him, by name, upon the ſtage, whileſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eealeth the names of the other two, and wholly hideth others, whom they can name. Alſo, they ſay, ſome were deſired by him, whom they could not thinck fit for them, in reſpect of theyre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and ingagements to other Churches, which would ſuffer much by the loſſe of them, though, in other reſpects, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them fit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To that which he addeth, concerning <hi>the fighting of ſome of theſe Complainants againſt his calling,</hi> they anſwer and profeſſe, that the fighting, which he meaneth, was not, out of diſeſteeme of, or diſaffection to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford, but for the defence and maintenance of theyre right, in which caſe, they would have oppoſed any other. For, ſeing how unjuſtly they were deprived of Mr. Hooker, whom they generally deſired, and having heard, that ſome of the Dutch Miniſters had ſayd, that, if they had knowne ſo much before, concerning him, as they had then heard matters ſhould not have bene carryed againſt him as they were: whereupon they conceyved hopes that they might yet injoy M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker. Hence came theyre oppoſition to Mr. B. calling, whom they thought the Anſwerer more forward to bring in, that he might deprive them of the other. But, ſince that time, finding theyre expectation and hope fruſtrate, they have wiſhed that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B. had bene ſetled amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Concerning the other two, ſeing the Anſwerer concealeth theyre names, I will be ſilent, and am ſorry that he concludeth that paſſage with perſiſting in his former fault of miſſappiying (&amp; ſo abuſing) the Scripture, which he alleadgeth for his owne purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Thus long I have bene excerciſed in a moſt unpleaſing worke of raking in a kennel of reproaches to find out my anſwer, which he directed me to ſeeke in theyres. And, in ſearching, I find no ſuch anſwer to them, as I looked for, viz, a diſproofe of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond proofe of the juſtnes of theyre complaint, concerning his depriving the Church of the free choyſe of theyre Paſtor. For
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20023:63"/> what free choyſe have they, when they may not have one of theyre owne Nation, immediately from England, but one that can ſpeake Dutch: and that one muſt be ſo and ſo principled, and framed to the bent of the Anſwerers ſpirit, as hath bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in the former Section? why is this required more of the Engliſh then of other Nations? Why doeth the Anſwerer preſſe this as a thing neceſſary, when the Magiſtrates only propound it as a thing convenient? Who ſeeth not, that, till he ſhewed his diſlike, both the Magiſtrates and Claſſis have approved of theſe very men, whom afterwards, upon his ſuggeſtions againſt them, they have refuſed? How then can it be accounted a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they complaine of him, for this cauſe? If he have no better anſwer for me, J ſhall remaine unanſwered, as they are, notwithſtanding any thing pretended by him to the contrary.</p>

So that I make the oppoſition of thoſe that have come immediately from England, a reall proofe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of having one that lived in theſe countryes; which deſire when it worketh ſo ſtrongly, as that thoſe that come immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely from England are more narrowly ſifted, and more violently oppoſed, then others, who, having lived in theſe parts, conſent with them in judgment; this I call <hi>urging.</hi> So that, ſuppoſe, this have not bene publickly urged by him <hi>allwayes,</hi> from the firſt day of his being called to that Church: yet if <hi>allwayes,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever men have come immediately from England, and have

As for the Anſwerer, I wiſh his age may be crowned with the honour of righteouſnes, upon his unfein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged repentance of theſe injuries, the guilt whereof he hath bene plunged into, I hope, by the violence of temptation, and not by a ſetled, and habituall evill bent of his ſpirit, out of which my prayer is unfeignedly, that God would recover him ſpeedily. And ſo I proceed to examine his anſwer, in this Section, and the concluſion of the former, againſt which I have diverſe excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

That he calleth it my <hi>complaint,</hi> which title I doe not give it, nor is it proper, it being rather an account, then a complaint, being intended for theyr ſatiſfaction, who deſired to know the

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20023:65"/> ſome information about things that concerned my ſelfe, from thence, or from my owne words. And whatſoever more is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from thence is to be returned back to his owne needleſſe jealouſy, from whence it came.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Except.]</hi> That he ſayth, <hi>Each of my threefold wrighting is ſtayned with untrueth, and matter of reproach.]</hi> but when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſhew it (that his Reader may be convinced hereof) he flyeth off from two of the wrightings, at the firſt onſet, <hi>which, for the preſent, he leaveth to the conſideration of the Claſſis.</hi> Yet, that he may not ſeeme to be wholly out of heart, he ſayth, <hi>He will ſo anſwer the third wrighting, as that he ſhall take them in by the way,</hi> &amp;c. For me; he may freely take his choyſe, whether he will anſwer all, or none, and whether, in every particular, or in groſſe: but he had dealt more fairely, if he had forborne to paſſe his ſentence, it being his worke to give evidence, not ſentence: but, it ſeemeth he durſt not reſt upon the aequanimity of the Reader, who is now made his judge, but would condemne it, leaſt elſe it might have paſſed altogether uncondemned.</p>
               <p>And ſeing he undertaketh to anſwer the third wrighting, in every particular, we ſhall (with Gods aſſiſtance) examine his anſwer, and the narration which he maketh of particulars touching my calling hither, with the iſſue thereof, which, if it be faythfully done, may give much light to helpe the Readers in judging righteouſly: elſe it will, like an <hi>ignis fatùus,</hi> miſleade them from the trueth.</p>

                  </label> 1, My end in comming into theſe parts, was to ſerve the preſent opportunity, for a few moneths, in helping that Church with the fruits of my labours, in their extreme neceſſity, having preſerved my liberty, not for love of eaſe, but for the workes ſake, (in hope that after ſome ſmall time of abſence, the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conceived againſt me would be abated, and my returne to myne owne country be made more ſafe,) and not to be Paſtor in Amſterdam, unleſſe it ſhould appeare, by a very ſtrong &amp; cleare call from the joynt deſire of Paſtor and people, upon very ſafe and ſatiſfying termes, that God, to whoſe diſpoſall, I wholly committed my ſelfe, ſhould deſigne me to that place, as the only ſtation wherein he would ſerve himſelfe of me, the remaynder of my dayes. In which caſe, my heart was prepared to obey his call, to any part of the world, and ſo there, and not otherwiſe. This being my purpoſe, as he that brought me over, and others can teſtifye, I was content to come over for 3 or 4 moneths to helpe them. And other agreement or promiſe I made none. Now what need was there of any letters from the Elderſhip for ſo much?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there had bene any further purpoſe or agreement to come over by a private ſollicitation, without publick order, yet in ſo doing, no good order was tranſgreſſed.

If I had wanted a teſtimony; it is well knowne to himſelfe, as well as to others, that I could ſoone have had one. 3.

When God calleth men to confeſſe the truth, by doing it, it incourageth them thereunto, whatſoever difficulties or impediments lye in the way, when he calleth them to witnes to it, by ſuffering, it ſtrengthneth them thereunto; But how? to ſuffer that tryall, not wherewith men would inſnare them, but wherewith it pleaſeth the Divine providence to excerciſe them. Men would impriſon them, but God ſtrongly inclineth theyr ſpirits, rather to chuſe a voluntary baniſhment, for a ſhort ſpace of time, which is a ſorer tryall then ſome impriſonment. And, in ſuch a caſe, flight it ſelfe is a reall confeſſion, and profeſſion that the truths of the Goſpel are of no ſmall value to them, who thus flye. For who had not rather tarry in his owne country, then leave his country, acquaintance, &amp; all the commodities which, with them, he might have injoyed, and travayle amongſt ſtrangers, whoſe language, diſpoſitions, and cuſtoms he knoweth not, where he is expoſed to many inconveniences, by the change of ayre and dyet, and to be reviled in his owne land, and ſuſpected amongſt ſtrangers, and to be ill intreated, oppreſſed, rejected, and in print traduced, by thoſe who ſhould have comforted, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced him, and to be brow-beaten by his inferiours, fhily looked upon by ſome aequalls, treacherouſly circumvented by others, obnoxious to the injuryes of all.

This was not to forſake the calling of God, but to follow it. The like I may ſay of Peter Martyrs relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20023:68"/> his ſtation in Luca, when he ſaw he could not with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hold it, it was not a deſerting of his flock, but a preſerving himſelfe for his flock, whom if he had not left for a time, they, and the whole Church had loſt for ever. I wil not now ſpeake of Policarpus, and Cyprian, &amp; others in former times, nor of thoſe who fled in Q: Maryes dayes, and were preſerved in Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furt, and other places for after times.</p>
               <p>In Hypotheſi.] For the juſtifying of myne owne act, in this particular (being injuriouſly compelled hereunto, in ſo publick a way, by the inconſiderate importunity of an angry brother who ſeemeth very regardleſſe how farr he expoſeth me to cenſure, or danger) I will breifely relate, both the cauſes of it, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my carriage in it. That the true cauſe may be knowne, falſe cauſes pretended by others, muſt be removed. For, this way, I have bene much wronged, whileſt many, out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or malice, or both, either willingly not knowing, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly concealing the truth, have taken an unwarrantable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpread abroad ſlanders, with as much confidence, as if they had bene trayned up in the Machiavells and Ieſuits princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re audac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</note> from theyr childhood.

               <p>But the truth is, that having about 17 yeares excerciſed a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick miniſtry in Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (about 9 or 10 yeares whereof I was in a Paſtorall charge in Colmanſtreet) Jn the latter part of that time I was much perplexed with doubts about the lawfullnes of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity, which I had formerly uſed, without ſcruple, in reſpect of ſome defects, &amp; corruptions, &amp; unwarrantable humaine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, whereunto I found my ſelfe thereby ſubjected. It is not requiſite in this place to relate, upon what occaſion or ground I became thus altered in my judgement; but thus much I will expreſſe. It was not from a diſlike of ſome one Ceremony only, but of many things amiſſe, and thoſe, not trifles, or things indifferent, but matters of great importance, and which I can not ſubmit to, nor doe, with ſatiſfaction to my conſcience in the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20023:69"/> ſight of God, though one thing occaſioned the diſcovery of that diſlike, which was not wraught at once, but by degrees, nor ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, but ſlowly, nor upon ſlight, but weighty conſiderations, nor without much labour, day and night. From that time, I ſaught how to free my ſelfe from former intanglements, in ſuch a manner, as might be moſt for the peace and proffit of the Church, being very fearefull (out of the peaceablenes of my ſpirit) of cauſing any publick diſturbance. Yet I ceaſed not to uſe thoſe meanes, for the ſatiſfaction of my doubts, which I thought moſt convenient for me, and know to be as ſufficient, as any I could uſe. Whileſt theſe things were in agitation; the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of my judgement (which I had kept ſecret from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſervation) was diſcovered by a letter, which one intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and opened, who ſoone acquainted his intimates with it, by whom it was whiſpered into the eares of many: the ſame man, I ſuſpected, would ſoone make it knowne to my Dioceſan, that then was, at his returne from Scotland, where he had wayted upon his Matie. Theſe things when I underſtood, I purpoſed, the weeke after his returne, to retire for a weeke or two, in to the Country, that I might diſcerne what was intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, by the manner of theyr inquiry after me. Upon this courſe I was hurried, rather then ſettled, by an unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which was this. Upon the munday after his returne, I rode a few miles from London to an ancient Reverend Divine, a Dr. in Divinity and my particular freind (upon a former agreement betweene us) to conferr with him about my doubts. But when it was knowne that I went out of towne, and not whither, ſome gave out that I was fled, which others too eaſily receyved and too confidently reported, &amp; ſpread it abroad, yet I returned, as I purpoſed at my riding foorth, that night, to a place within 2 or 3 miles of London, and ſtayed there the next day, where I was not a litle troubled at the clamour, which, I heard, was made by many, about my ſuppoſed flight, fearing that it would much ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate and incenſe authority againſt me, and accordingly was, even that weeke, advertiſed of a ſtorme gathered in a thick cloud, and ready to fall upon me. Whereupon I retired a ſmall
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20023:69"/> diſtance from London, for a few weekes, to ſee what iſſue the Lord would put to theſe overtures. In which time, 3 requeſts were, on my behalfe, and at my intreaty, propounded to the Biſhop of that dioceſſe, that then was, by his anſwer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I perceived that extremity was intended againſt mee. Yet I did not reſigne, till the Biſhop had cauſed the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens to be examined concerning me, by the Regiſter of the High Commiſſion, whereby it appeared that he purpoſed to deale with me ſpeedily, in that Court, if, by reſigning, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it not. Nevertheles, I did not yet reſigne up my place, till I had called the Church together in a generall Veſtry, and propounded the matter to them, acquainting them with my caſe, praying them to adviſe freely what was beſt to be done, for theyre good and myne.

               <p>As I acknowledge the Church to have this right in their paſtor, ſo I told them, that if they ſhould find that any hurt would redound to them by my reſignation, which by my holding the place would be prevented, I would hold it, what-ever ſhould befall me.</p>
               <p>They ſeriouſly adviſing upon the propoſition made by me, and knowing that the liberty and power of chuſing theyre Paſtor was in themſelves (which alſo ſecured me from feare that a wolfe ſhould be obtruded upon them, after my departure, without which aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I would not have reſigned it) &amp; it being thought
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20023:70"/> by ſome to be better for the Church, that I ſhould quietly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, then, by holding the place, to expoſe them to ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences (which I forbeare to mention at this time) they freely conſented to my reſignation. Jn teſtimony whereof the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens (in the name and ſervice of the reſt) joyned with me in all that was done about it. Thus I was freely diſmiſſed by the ſame power that called me to that miniſtry. The reaſons, which inclined me to preſerve my liberty, were theſe. 1. the ſeverity of the Canons againſt thoſe, who, having formerly ſubſcribed, and conformed, doe alter theyre judgment and practiſe. 2. the Biſhops owne threatnings uttered to me, in particular, formerly, that, in this caſe, I muſt expect, that they would be more ſevere againſt mee, then ſome others; becauſe my example (he ſayd) would doe more hurt. 3. J was ſatifyed, in my conſcience, upon good grounds, that I might doe more ſervice to the Church, by preſerving the liberty of my perſon, then by lying (&amp; for ought I know, dying) in priſon, and it may be, in cloſe priſon. And in this reſolution I was ſtrengthned, as by good adviſe, ſo by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teſtimonyes, that, in this courſe, I ſhould more pleaſe God (all things being conſidered) then in the other, being (as it ſeemed to me) guided thereunto by the eye of God, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence fore ſhewed me, both the danger, and the way of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and by the mouth of God, whoſe word warranted me ſo to doe, and by the hand of God (as I have already ſhewen) who ſtrongly inclined my ſpirit, upon the forementioned grounds, thereunto. So that I could not ſatiſfye my ſelfe, in theſe reſpects, that, if I ſhould doe otherwiſe, I could be free from the guilt of tempting God. Thus I have ingenuouſly, and plainely reported the trueth. Wherein, if the Godly and judicious Reader ſhall find any thing done by me, through humane infirmity, that agreeth not with the rule, my humble requeſt is, that he will, in brotherly love, helpe me, with his light, that I may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thereof by the Scripture, and he ſhall find me ready to receive a freindly and juſt rebuke, with due meekenes, and thanckfullnes. But, if otherwiſe, he ſhall ſee cauſe to juſtifye my way (which, I thinck, if he judge righteouſly, he will) let him ſuffer me to ſtand right in his good opinion, and condemne
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20023:70"/> himſelfe, in the ſight of God, if he have miſjudged me. As for the Anſwerer: Either let him convince me of ſinne in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or beare the juſt blame of an unjuſt reproofe, or reproach rather, which is ſo much the greater injury, as, by being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is made more notorious and ſcandalous.</p>
               <p>After the buiſenes of my reſignation was in this manner tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacted, I expected peace, but behold new troubles. For another purſivant was ſent out for me, who gave out great threatnings. And this inclined me to accept of the motion from theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, wherein, I thought, I might be ſafe in my perſon, and proffitable, in the fruit of Gods bleſſing upon my labours to that Church, for a time, and that, upon my abſence, the diſpleaſure conceived againſt me would be mitigated, and my returne, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a convenient time, would be made more ſafe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For juſtifying of my inference, from his preaching againſt my reſignation, to prove that he never deſired me for his Colleague, I need not uſe many words.

And, that it may more appeare to all men, even in the Sections where my confidence in him and kindnes ſhould be mentioned, there he laboured moſt to injure me with caſting intimations to rayſe ſuſpitions in mens minds cauſeleſly. To be breife. To what end are all theſe words?</p>
               <p>Are they to prove that I had ſeene in wrighting a copy of the differences betweene the Anſwerer &amp; Mr. Hooker? J grant it, but withall I affirme three things. 1. That it was long before I left London, and, when I was farr from any thoughts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into theſe parts, and leaving mine owne land, and ſo had no cauſe to fixe my mind upon thoughts of thoſe matters. 2. That my comming over was but for 3 or 4 moneths. He that brought me over, thoſe that wrote for me, the freinds I left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, all know, and can witnes it. The Anſwerer himſelfe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I told him ſo, when I firſt viſited him. 3. That in Mr. H. anſwer to the queſtion, there doeth not appeare light ſufficient to informe any man what that is, which in the Dutch cuſtom about Baptiſme, he diſliked. And, when he propounded the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to me, about this matter, I did not underſtand, in what particular, the difference betweene the Anſwerer and Mr. H. lay.</p>
               <p>Or, ſecondly, Would he intimate that I ſaught the place, or went about to intrude my ſelfe, for continuance? 1. Himſelfe knoweth, that, when he, with one of the Elders, preſented to me a call from the Conſiſtory, I did not ſuddenly accept it (which I would have done, if I had ſo deſired the place, as he inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) but tooke time to conſider of it, being not ſatiſfyed about the lawfullnes of the conditions propounded to me. 2, Himſelfe hath reported that I might have had the place, but I refuſed it: which is true, being underſtood in that ſenſe, wherein it is ſayd of thoſe <hi>worthyes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35.</note> that <hi>they would not be delivered,</hi> viz, not upon unwarrantable, and ill conditions. But this is ſufficient to cleare me of that imputation of inordinately deſiring that place.</p>
               <p>Or, thirdly, Would he have his credulous Reader to ſuſpect my trueth, when I ſay that I came over but for 3 or 4 moneths?
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20023:71"/> Elſe, what meane thoſe 4 praeſumptions, which he inſinuateth to ſuggeſt the contrary? To which I will anſwer breifely.</p>
               <p>To the firſt, <hi>For a man of plauſible gifts, eminent, and of fame, &amp; wanting preſent imployment, to preſent himſelfe where a place is vacant where much contention hath bene &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer. 1. For the titles which he giveth me, I account them, as they fall from his pen, but <hi>an honourable reproach.</hi> 2. For the matter of it:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Honorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia.</hi> Hieron ad Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: &amp; Ocean.</note> The extreame neceſſity of the place, he being ſo weake and unfit to preach, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the importunity of thoſe that ſollicited me, was the cauſe moving me (who then was out of imployment, and in continuall danger) to come over to that place, chuſing rather to caſt my ſelfe upon Gods providence, in perills of the ſea, and in a ſtrange land, where I might be of ſome uſe to the Church, for a time, then to live privately, but neither ſafely nor proffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, in my owne land, in hope that 3 or 4 moneth would quiet, and pacifye theyre ſpirits, that were moſt exaſperated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt me, without any juſt cauſe; that ſo my returne to my owne land might be with ſafety and comfort. What if this might give them occaſion of ſeeking, and calling me? will it thence follow, that <hi>I ſaught the place before I was called?</hi> or <hi>that I did intrude, or thruſt my ſelfe in for a Paſtor?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> or <hi>that I runne before I was ſent,</hi> as he ſlandereth me before? No marvell, if <hi>diverſe learned and godly Miniſters, being theyre neighbours in this country, have bene loath to ſhew themſelves in this place &amp;c. leaſt they ſhould ſeeme to offer themſelves unto this calling.</hi> For they knew the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers diſpoſition and ſpirit, and the contentions which have thereby bene in this place, which if I had knowne, ſo as now I doe, no perſwaſions ſhould have drawne me thither. And it is very likely, that I had ſtayed at Rotterdam till the Elderſhip had ſent for me, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. H. did, if the neceſſity of the place had not hurryed me ſooner, to prevent the ſhutting up of the Church dores, which (as I have bene told, and the event ſhewed) would come to paſſe the next Lords day, if my comming prevented it not. Yet two of the Elders, with ſome other members of the Congregation, met me at Harlem, and accompanied me to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, &amp; tooke care for my accomodation with a convenient intertaynment: and, the joy, that was generally expreſſed ſoone
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20023:72"/> after my being there was knowne, ſhewed a great deſire in the members that they might injoy me, And the Anſwerer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, at that time, acknowledged Gods good providence in my being there, at that time, and joyntly with the Elders, who were then preſent, when I firſt viſited him, intreated my helpe the Lords day following, and ſo long as my time would permit, and theyre need ſhould require.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond praeſumption, that <hi>they that ſent for me, and I. C. that fetched me over, did not ſeeke me but for</hi> 3 <hi>or</hi> 4 <hi>moneths;</hi> J an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 1. Suppoſe theyr deſire was to injoy me longer; will it thence follow, that I yeelded for longer time? 2. By what hath bene formerly ſaid it appeareth ſufficiently that I agreed with him for no longer time, which himſelfe is able and ready to teſtifye. if it be required.</p>
               <p>To the third praeſumption; that <hi>the freind which by an open and unſealed letter, which I brought unto him from London, intreated him to receive me for a fellow helper, did not deſire that for</hi> 3 <hi>or</hi> 4 <hi>moneths only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer. I thinck, never did Laban ſearch ſo narrowly Iacobs ſtuff to find his Idolls, as this Anſwerer doeth to find an untrueth in my aſſertion. To what end is this brought in? If he thinck, or would perſwade others, that I procured that freinds letter that I might obtaine the place, he is much deceived. For neither ſtands it with my judgment to ſeeke a place (much leſſe by ſuch private recommendations) nor need I the letters of any private freind, having a more publick teſtimony. And how litle I min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that letter, may appeare in this, that I know not that it was unſealed, and, if indeed it was unſealed, I know not at all what was written in it. It is likely, that, knowing the authour of it to be my approved freind, and one that hath deſerved well of the Anſwerer, I ſuppoſed, he would commend me to him affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately, to be lovingly intertayned, &amp; uſed by him in a ſtrange Country, and ſo tooke no further heed to it. But, what if that freind did intreate him to receive me for a fellowhelper? Will it follow thence, that I ſaught it? who ſeeth not the vanity of theſe pretences?</p>
               <p>To the fourth praeſumption. That <hi>it was not likely, that,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20023:72"/> after</hi> 3 <hi>or</hi> 4 <hi>moneths preaching amongſt them, I could eaſily be diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and theyre labour and care of ſeeking and calling another must be interruped, if not wholly broken off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer. 1. Grant all this to be true: will it thence follow that I ſaught it? 2. Grant, that at the end of 3 or 4 moneths, I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of a call to that place (which it is probable, I ſhould have done, if it had bene offered upon ſafe conditions, rather then to live without publick imployment) will it thence follow, that I inordinately deſired, or baſely, or unworthily ſaught it, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably, or without a calling intruded my ſelfe? 3. what hindrance could my mere preaching there be to theyre ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or calling another, if I ſhould refuſe it? Let the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Iudge.</p>
               <p>To what he ſayth in the two following anſwers, about the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of my knowing <hi>the ſtate of the Dutch Churches, whet her I ſtayed here or not.</hi> I Anſwer, that even for that Reaſon, my comming over was needfull. For no mans word or letters could make that ſo well knowne to me, as myne owne obſervation, &amp; experience hath done. But the ſuppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereupon he groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that opinion, I doe not approve. For, in ſome caſes, a good conſcience ſuffers a man to be neutrall, viz, in thoſe things which he is not bound to know or practiſe, &amp; wherein he hath wanted occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or meanes of full informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And what hurt can that man be ſuppoſed to doe, by private conference, who ſuſpendeth his judgment, and determineth neyther way? Are not theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges mere roapes of ſand?</p>
               <p>Laſtly. Whereas he ſeemeth to doubt, in the beginning of this Section, whether I came not <hi>over with a diſcordant mind;</hi> I profeſſe, in ſimplicity of my heart, that I came over with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent eſteeme of him, and with confidence that I ſhould reape more fruits of his brotherly love then I have received, and was farr from any purpoſe of rayſing contention, which I naturally abhorr, or ſuſpition, that I ſhould have met with ſuch conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as I have bene troubled with, which if I had foreſeene, J ſhould never have come to Amſterdam. Yet I doe not repine at, but contentedly ſubmit to that good hand of Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which brought me hither, and is pleaſed this way
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20023:73"/> to trye me, and doe with a childelike ſubmiſſion and reverence (in my meaſure) kiſſe the rod in my Fathers hand, even when I lament the unkindnes of my Elder brother, which yet I would not have publiſhed, if he would have ſuffered me to be ſilent.</p>

               <head>The Anſwer to the eleventh Section exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Of the private conference had with me after my comming over.</head>
               <p>IN this Section three things are to be conſidered. 1. his gird at Mr. Hook: 2. His partiall and defective report of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene us. 3. his pretended anſwer to ſome paſſages in my third wrighting. Theſe we will examine ſeverally and breifely.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. 1. the <hi>great diſturbance,</hi> which here he ſeemeth to impute to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hook: is to be charged upon himſelfe, and his owne violent and unjuſt oppoſition againſt Mr. Hook: and the Church, and not at all to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     <hi>Ast.</hi> 19.22.</note> the cauſe whereof was Demetrius &amp; his companions. 2. It would be knowne how I <hi>ſeemed to accord</hi> with him, and to diſlike Mr. Hook: opinions, in generall? If he meane, by my my ſilence, I confeſſe, I heard him ſpeake ſome things, at which I was ſilent, being not called to ſpeake. For himſelfe ſaid, that, in ſome of their differences, he would not inquire after my opinion, being perſwaded that I was therein cleare, And, in concluſion, pitched upon two queſtions. 1. Concerning the power and authority of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſſes, whereunto what I anſwered he knoweth. 2. Concerning promiſcuous adminiſtration of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, according to the cuſtom of the Dutch Church in Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtam, wherein what I held and doe hold ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond. By comparing this report with my noates of our conferences (which I wrote upon my returne to my lodging
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20023:73"/> whileſt matters were freſh in memory) I finde it to be partiall and defective.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>partiall,</hi> in declaring the ſtate of the queſtion, which was not as he intimateth, but thus. After an hyſtoricall narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by him of a difference betweene the Claſſis and Mr. Hook; about a cuſtom, which the Miniſters of the Dutch Church in Amſterdam have, of baptizing all that are brought by whomſoever, he aſked me what I thought of it. I deſired (for my ſatiſfaction) to know wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t their cuſtom was, being then, in part, ignorant thereof. He told me, that they baptized all, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing none. I replyed, that I would baptize all their infants, who were members of his Church, refuſing none. He ſayd, that is not ſufficient. I, deſiring to carry matters with all poſſible peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes, told him that I would not refuſe to baptize others alſo, which were no members of his Church, if I were ſatiſfyed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Parents, and inſtanced in ſuch as might occaſionally be there from England, &amp; were ſufficiently knowne to me. But yet the caſe might be ſuch, in ſome others, as I ſhould not adventure to doe it. He anſwered. But here they except none, but baptize all that are brought, though the parents be not knowne, or the infant be preſented, in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thers abſence, by perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. I told him, that, I hoped, ſuch caſes were ſeldom, eſpecially in the Engliſh Church. He ſaid, it muſt be expected to fall out often. I told him, I ſhould deſire to be ſatiſfyed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the parents, before the child were preſented. He ſayd. They would often bring them, in ſermon time, without giving any notice before, and, in ſuch a caſe, to refuſe any, would give offence, if the child ſhould be unbaptized. I replyed, that offence may be prevented, ſeing thoſe, whom I dare not admit, may repayre to the Dutch Church, where none are refuſed. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it would give offence to the Claſſis, if our Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hould not doe as they did, in this. I anſwered, the difference betweene the ſmall Engliſh Church, &amp; the vaſt Dutch Church in the ſame towne being conſidered, that might eaſily be anſwered.</p>
               <p>By all which it appeareth that the thing which I refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (and whereupon our difference aroſe) was the promiſcuous adminiſtration of baptiſme to all that are preſented, by whom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoever;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20023:74"/> and not that J made the parents ſubmiſſion to my private examination a neceſſary condition of baptiſme, but only I propounded it as a prudent meane for avoyding that promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous baptizing which he required. Thus the Reader may ſee the report to be partiall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is <hi>defective,</hi> not mentioning diverſe paſſages of diſcourſe betweene us, which I will but point at. As about an order in the Claſſis, which he ſayd was for this, concerning which, what I demanded and, what he anſwered, I will, for this time, conceale, as alſo what he ſpake about this cuſtom being alwaies obſerved in that Church, as alſo about paſſages that, he ſayd, had bene betweene the Claſſis, and Mr. Forbes about Mr. Hooker, in reference to this queſtion. He omitteth alſo our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about the caſe of an unbaptized Turke preſenting his child to baptiſme, with no other profeſſion then that which is required in theyre Church. And how he thought it to be more for a mans ſatiſfaction, to baptize all, upon the injunction of the Claſſis, then to refuſe any, upon his owne judgement. Other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages alſo I could name, but theſe may ſuffice, to ſhew that his memory hath not retayned particulars ſo well as my noates, at leaſt, that this report is defective. But let us conſider his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>By this relation the Reader may ſee how eaſily the imagined inconveniences might have bene prevented, if the Anſwerer had bene willing thereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is not true, that <hi>all the Church generally would tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> (as he ſayth) <hi>to ſee a double practiſe.</hi> For, at that time, all the Church generally deſired that ſome courſe might be agreed upon, for accommodation in this matter, and, to this day, they diſlike the Anſwerers ſtiffnes and averſnes thereunto. And what double practiſe could they ſee, in the way which I propou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </label> But another inconvenience he feared, which, in this place he concealeth, but then expreſſed to me, which was, that he ſhould be ſuſpected and cenſured as a man of evill conſcience, if he ſhould practiſe that which I refuſe, as unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I anſwer. That will not follow. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                  </label> For 1. two men may differ in practiſe, and yet be boath upright, whileſt they walke according to their light, not refuſing any meanes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and conviction, if they erre, &amp; maintaining brotherly love amongſt themſelves. 2. It might have bene ſo ordered, at firſt, if he would, that the difference betweene us might not be knowne to others. But this we ſhall ever find, that cauſeles jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſyes, and ſelfe-aymes and reſpects are, and will be the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance and baine of any publick good.

               <p>Secondly. The Scriptures alleadged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſayth, were two, from whence he <hi>ſhewed, that when ſo great multitudes were at once baptized by Iohn Baptiſt.

                  </gap>o the inſtance of Iohns Baptiſing. 1. The text ſayeth. <hi>They were baptiſed of Iohn in Iordan confeſſing theyr ſinnes.</hi> Whence it is manifeſt that Iohn was ſatiſfyed concerning theyre fitnes to be baptiſed, before he admitted them. And that is all that I require. 2. How will it appeare that ſo many were baptiſed of him at once? I rather am of opinion, that thoſe places doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the ſtory of the wholl time of Iohns Miniſtry, ſo farr as concerneth his baptiſme, in which time multitudes might be baptiſed by him, and yet he ſufficiently informed concerning their fitnes to partake of it.</p>

For the text fayth.<note place="margin">

               <p>Whereas he ſayth. <hi>By conference of other Scriptures, theyre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their ſinnes, and profeſſion of fayth were rather to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome ſolemne and publick teſtification of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. 1. he ſhould have ſet downe thoſe other Scriptures, which, being conferred with theſe, decl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20023:76"/> &amp; Peter of perſwaſion that they had repented and did beleive. If ſo; I deſire no more. If not; how are the one ſort ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſinnes ſo, as to declare their repentance? For, ſo it muſt be underſtood, as appeareth. 1. In that Iohns baptiſme is called <hi>the baptiſme of repentance, for remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> 2. In his diſcourſe with the publicans and ſouldiers that came to him to be baptiſed. 3. In that <hi>the Phariſes, and Lawyers</hi> are ſayd to <hi>reject the counſail of God, against themſelves, being not baptiſed of him.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Elſe why are thoſe of the other ſort, whom Peter bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſaid to <hi>receive the word gladly,</hi> and to <hi>believe</hi> &amp;c. Was there, in all this, no more then ſuch a teſtification of conſent unto the doctrine preached, as is made in the Dutch Church, in ſaying <hi>Yae,</hi> or nodding the head, when, it may be, they underſtand not one word that is ſpoken? Or had Peter and Iohn no other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the perſons, whom they baptiſed, then they have, who adminiſter it promiſcuouſly to all that are brought, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, refuſing none?</p>
               <p>Now, ſeing the Anſwerer uſed no other Arguments, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, then theſe, the wiſe hearted Reader, I thinck, will not wonder that <hi>by ſuch private conferences he prevayled nothing with me, in this point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the third particular obſerveable in this Section, viz, his pretended anſwers to ſome paſſages in my third wrighting.</p>
               <p>Firſt, About the report of my refuſing to diſpute or conferr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this point, when he deſired it, ſeing he denyeth that he ſo reported, and confeſſeth the contrary, I am ſatiſfyed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, About his deſire of having the queſtion in wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diſcuſſed betweene us, ſeing J have ſayd ſome thing in anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the third Section I wil ſay no more, but this, the motion was not aequall, nor did any propound it to me.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where as he ſayth, that he remembreth not that ever I propounded any Argument, in maintenance of myne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, the Reader may ſee how litle his memory is to be truſted in theſe reports, unles the profaning of Gods ordinance, and the incouragement of Libertines, be not unlawfull, which I ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to be inſeperably joyned with this promiſcuous baptiſing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whereas he loadeth me with reproaches, for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20023:77"/> wrighting downe, when I came home to my lodging, the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches betweene us, without his knowledge, I am ſo farr from conceiving my ſelfe to be guilty of any fault therein, that I wiſh heartily he had taken the ſame courſe, and then, I hope, the Reader ſhould not have bene abuſed with ſo many miſreports, as now he is, by the fault of his memory. As for me; foreſeing to what iſſue things might come, and diſtruſting my memory, that I might be able to report the truth, I wrote downe paſſages, as I could remember, whileſt things were yet freſh in memory, and kept the wrighting, to this day, ſecret, having never ſhewen it to any man, nor have, at this time, related ſome things which, I thinck, the Anſwerer would be loath to heare of in print, and thoſe which he compelleth me to utter, I report ſparingly. Let the Godly Reader judge what offence I have committed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or what injury he hath done in ſuch expreſſions, as he uſeth upon this occaſion, yea, whether it be not plaine rayling.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He pretendeth that, in my firſt wrighting to the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, J offend, both in exceſſe, and in defect. This is a mere cavill: which will appeare, if all that he ſayth be granted, againſt which nevertheles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have juſt exception. But be it, that his queſtion was, as he ſayth: <hi>What meaſure of knowledge I would, in my exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, require of parents for the baptiſing of their children.</hi> Yet 1. Was this the only queſtion? was not that queſtion, which is mentioned in my letter to the Claſſis, put by him? yea, was not that the principall queſtion? Elſe, it was not to the purpoſe. Was nothing elſe propounded by me to be conſidered, in this caſe, but ſuch a degree of knowledge? If ſo; why did I except againſt profeſſed Libertines, who may have more knowledge then ſome members of the Church?</p>
               <p>As for my anſwer to it, that the <hi>meaſure of knowledg could not be declared, till the time of examining the perſons;</hi> Let the Reader judge, whether a more ſatiſfactory anſwer could be given to that queſtion, and whether it be <hi>from the point,</hi> about which his queſtion was.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, His anſwer to what J wrote of my <hi>not ceaſing, till he gave over, of leaving it to the Dutch preachers,</hi> and of his ſaying, <hi>that he would ſpeake no more with me alone,</hi> is a plaine conceſſion

               <p>Here it muſt be noated that the Anſwerer pretendeth to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this wrighting. 1. <hi>So as it was done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tranſacted in his houſe the</hi> 28. <hi>day of Ianuary</hi> 1634. 2. <hi>So as it was written downe and read before him, when they enquired of him, whether he, for his part, did reſt therein, and he ſignifyed his conſent with them.</hi> Theſe things being premiſed, J demand, by what pretence, will the Anſwerer defend or excuſe this his tranſlation. Let me, without offence, deſire to know, why he hath tranſlated <hi>quorum parentes, ſuſceptoreſve conſtat eſſe Chriſtianos,</hi> whoſe parents <hi>and</hi> ſuretyes are manifeſt to be Chriſtians? when, according to their wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it ſhould be tranſlated whoſe parents <hi>or</hi> ſuretyes are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to be Chriſtians? Here is <hi>[or]</hi> a diſjunctive particle changed into <hi>[and]</hi> a particle copulative, to the manifeſt alteration of the ſenſe of their words. That this is not the errour of the printer, but done purpoſely, by the authour, appeareth from his conſtant private report, that I refuſed to baptiſe the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch, whoſe parents were manifeſt Chriſtians. To make this good, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath a falſe tranſlation obtruded upon him. I demand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if that diſjunctive expreſſion of the five Duth Miniſters in their wrighting [viz, parents, <hi>or</hi> ſuretyes] were juſtifyable, why doth he alter it into a copulative expreſſion. [viz parents, <hi>and</hi> ſuretyes?] If it were not juſtifyable, why did he ſignify his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, and that he, for his part, reſted therein? 2. Why am J blamed, yea, rejected, for not reſting in it? what will he, what can he ſay, in excuſe thereof? That the Dutch preachers were willing afterwards, upon my ſhewing my diſlike, to change
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20023:80"/> 
                  <hi>[ve into que] or,</hi> into, <hi>and,</hi> and therefore he altered it. I anſwer 1. ſuch a thing was in ſpeech, but never done: for when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take pen and paper and to wright downe agreements on both ſides, after ſome litle diſcourſe, they altered their minds, ſaying that they had no commiſſion to make any agreements, till they had acquainted the Claſſis therewith, which they would doe. And after that time, they never ſpake more of altering any thing. So it ſtood, and ſtandeth to this day unaltered. 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it had bene altered by them (as it was not) yet the Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer wil have no advantage thereby: for he profeſſeth to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it according to that copy, wherein he ſignifyed his conſent with them, and required that I ſhould reſt, which is apparently falſifyed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He blameth me for <hi>complaining that he dealt extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely with me, and rejected all my labour for a peaceable compoſing, prudent accommodating, and brotherly ending of matters betweene him and me privately, or by the counſail of the Elders of his owne Church, nor would hearken to my adviſe without conſent of the Claſſis. All theſe reports,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>are untruths. And this wrighting,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>witneſſeth for him, &amp;c.</hi> Three things I affirme in thoſe wrightings, and they are all true.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that he rejected my labour for accommodation. The truth of that appeareth in that himſelfe ſaid, in the beginning of this Section, that he offered, that if any other convenient way of accommodation could be found out, he would willingly hearken to it: Let it be noated that he ſayth, <hi>any other,</hi> and thereby plainly refuſed that which was propounded by me? elſe why is <hi>any other</hi> way ſaught.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>that he would not yeeld any brotherly moderation unto me, and refuſed all meanes of accommodation.</hi> The truth hereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the meanes which he embraced, or, rather put thoſe Miniſters upon to propound to me (having praepoſſeſſed them with cauſeles jealouſyes) when it is required, that I ſhould reſt in a wrighting (which himſelfe is loath to tranſlate aright, that the Reader may know the wholl truth) wherein I am adviſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aptize all children, <hi>whoſe parents, or ſuretyes are Chriſtians,</hi> by which accomodation, I ſhall be brought to doe the thing which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20023:80"/> I judge unlawfull. For, if a Chriſtian ſurety may give right to an infant for baptiſme, whoſe parents are neither of them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and ſuch midwives, or nurſes, or others as take no future care of the child may paſſe for ſuretyes, and muſt be accounted manifeſt Chriſtians, if they nodd the head, or ſay <hi>yae,</hi> at the reading or pronouncing of the <hi>formalier</hi> by the miniſter, though no man knoweth what they are, nor themſelves, it may be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a word that is ſayd to them; who ſeeth not that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ordinance of Baptiſme is hereby made common, and ſo to be promiſcuouſly adminiſtred, according to this wrighting?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>that he would not hearken to my advice without conſent of the Claſſis.</hi> 1. That this is true, he muſt confeſſe, unles he will deny his owne words: for himſelfe ſayd ſo to me, &amp; he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, 2. The event ſheweth it. For though he would have me to reſt in this wrighting (without conſent of the Claſſis) yet he well knew this to be no way of accommodation, hut a mere ſnare to me.</p>
               <p>And now, becauſe the Anſwerer, not only ſeemeth to charge me with obſtinacy for not reſting in that determination of the five miniſters, but alſo to inſult as if J wanted warrant from the Scripture for myne opinion, becauſe I did not <hi>ſet it downe in wrighting, that the queſtion might be in wrighting diſcuſſed betweene us,</hi>

                  <hi>which he offered</hi> (as he ſayth) <hi>to ſome of the Complainants ſundry times,</hi> (though the vanity of this pretence is in the former Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, declared, yet,) being thus againe chalenged in print, I may not, without injury to the truth, any longer forbeare to give a publick account of my judgement in this matter. But firſt my humble and hearty requeſt to the Reverend miniſters of theſe countryes (eſpecially to thoſe in that part) is, that they will not impute it to any contentious diſpoſition, or to loue of diſputes, much leſſe to a malicious deſire of diſcovering theyr imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the world, leaſt of all to an arrogant polupragmony in me, as if I, being a ſtranger, aſſumed to my ſelfe to be a reformer of theſe Churches, that I freely declare the grounds, whereupon I refuſed to bind my ſelfe to obſerve that cuſtom. Thus caſting my ſelfe upon theyr favourable conſtruction, and praying them aequally and judiciouſly to conſider what J ſay, I will, with Gods
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:20023:81"/> aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, (which I humbly begg) proceed to declare my grounds after I have ſtated the queſtion, by ſhewing the iſſue and ſumme of that wrighting of the five miniſters, wherein the Anſwerer would bind me to reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſtate of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note>Breifly, it was, that I ſhould adminiſter the ſacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to all infants that are preſented thereunto, if thoſe that preſent them (whether they be parents, or ſuretyes) ſhall declare themſelves to be Chriſtians, by profeſſing Chriſtian Religion, at the reading of the leitourgy of Baptiſme, though the preſenters are altogether unknowne to us, yea, though they will not, or cannot ſatiſfye the miniſter before, that they are ſuch, as in whom the infant hath a right to baptiſme. This to be ſo, will eaſily appeare to the intelligent Reader, if he examine the wrighting which they ſent to me. The Anſwerer and the five miniſters required it, as a condition of my admittance to the paſtorall office, in that Church, that I ſhould reſt in this wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. By <hi>resting in it</hi> they meant (as both, he and they whom the Claſſis deputed to ſpeake with me, expreſſed themſelves) that I ſhould promiſe to conforme thereunto: which is, in few words, to adminiſter baptiſme promiſcuouſly to all that are preſented, by whomſoever, according to the cuſtom of that place.</p>
               <p>This being the true ſtate of the queſtion, that the validity of my grounds againſt this cuſtom may appeare, I muſt crave leave to premiſe ſome things, 1.

Their manner is, that, if, either the father, or any one that ſtandeth for him as a ſurety (though it be but a nurſe or other body, who is unknowne to the Church) who hath no charge or care for the childes education, if they come time enough, they certifye the Coſter, or Sexton, of the name of the parents, and their deſire before: if not (as ſometimes they bring them not till they are baptiſing others, after the ſermon is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) then, without any further enquiry after the parents, or after their conſent to the baptiſing of it, the child is admitted.</p>
               <p>

For to prove that infants dying without Baptiſme might be ſaved, he ſhewed that the righteouſnes of fayth belongeth to them before they are baptiſed, out of Rom: 4.11.<note place="margin">

This he amplifyeth by ſhewing that baptiſme is a ſymbol and ſeale of Adoption in Chriſt, and therefore aught not to be given to thoſe that have no part in Chriſt, becauſe the ſeale followeth the gift, and therefore to give the ſeale to him that hath not the gift, &amp; to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is not made, is to abuſe the ſeale, and to profane it.

From whence, how eaſily may it be collected that infants are deprived of right to thoſe holy myſteryes in ſuch parents, as the Iſmaelites, and Edomites were deprived of right to Circumciſion, in Iſmael and Eſau, though their parents had bene circumciſed?</p>
               <p>Before boath theſe, Mr. Cartwright declared the ſame thing more fully and particularly to the caſe in queſtion,<note place="margin">Mr. Cart: Reply to Dr. W: in defence of the Adm: p: <hi>137.</hi>
                  </note> upon the ſame ground. For Dr. W.

If one of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents be, neither drunkard, nor adulterer, the child is holy, by vertue of the covenant, for one of the parents ſake: if they be boath, &amp; yet not obſtinate in their ſinne, whereby the Church hath proceeded to excommunication (themſelves being yet of the Church) their child cannot, nor aught not to be refuſed. To the ſecond queſtion, wherein he aſketh, what if the child be of papiſts or hereticks? If boath be papiſts or condemned hereticks (if ſo be J may diſtinguiſh papiſts from hereticks) &amp; cut off from the Church, their children can not be received; becauſe they are not in the covenant. If either of them be

Yes verily may they (ſayth he) So may have, and have the Turckes, and Jewes, and yet their children are not to be received, unles their fayth doth firſt appeare by confeſſion.

               <p>To adminiſter baptiſme to the infants of thoſe who belong not to Chriſt, who are convicted &amp; judged by the Church to be ſwine and doggs, who obſtinately perſiſt in their Apoſtaſy, who ſlight and refuſe all communion with all viſible Churches of Chriſt, who are ſtrangers, and without, In a word, who have no communion with Chriſt, nor fellowſhip with the Church and people of God, is to profane it, according to the judgement of Whittaker, Beza, Cartwright, I: del'Eſpine, I.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20023:86"/> as that wrighting requireth, is to adminiſter it to many ſuch.</p>

               <p>To cleare this, I am to declare two things, 1. that it is a ſinne to give offence. 2, that this practiſe doth give offence (or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall) to many.</p>
               <p>Firſt. That it is a ſinne to give offence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13.21.16 15. <hi>Ezek:</hi> 13.22. <hi>Rom:</hi> 14.3 10. <hi>Mat:</hi> 18.10. <hi>Rom:</hi> 14.15.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</note> will appeare by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture light, which forbideth it, &amp; deſcribeth it to be a <hi>putting an occaſion to fall,</hi> or <hi>laying a stumbling block before a brother,</hi> a <hi>making him weake,</hi> a <hi>giving him cauſe to ſpeake evill, or to thinck hardly of us,</hi> a <hi>pleaſing our ſelves,</hi> with neglect of our brother, and it propcee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from a <hi>diſpiſing</hi> and light regard of others in our hearts, and it tendeth to the <hi>deſtroying</hi> of him. And, to conclude, it is to <hi>ſinne againſt our brother,</hi> and to <hi>ſinne againſt Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. That this practiſe doth give ſcandall to many. This we will declare by induction, and inſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt. To the Iewes it is an offence that we affirme our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to be in ſtead of their circumciſion, and of the ſame uſe and worth, and yet we communicate it to thoſe who are not in the Covenant, ſo much as viſibly and outwardly: which they know to be contrary to the law given to their fathers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning circumſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly. To the Papiſts it is an offence that we,<note place="margin">Tho: Aq: pars <hi>3.</hi> queſt: <hi>68.</hi> Idem. ſecund. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundae queſt: <hi>10.</hi> art: <hi>12.</hi> &amp; alibi.

Dr. Whittaker addeth, that <hi>they doe abſurdly, who baptiſe the children of unbeleivers, though the parents ſhould deſire it, as if</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the Church might give baptiſme to whom they pleaſe.</hi> For then they might be baptiſed, even without the parents conſent.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:20023:87"/>
               <p>Thirdly. To the Anabaptiſts it is an offence, who, becauſe the Scripture requireth fayth to baptiſme (not only unjuſtly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scripture, diſlike the baptiſing of the infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers, but alſo) complaine, and that juſtly, of the promiſcuous adminiſtring of baptiſme, even to thoſe whoſe parents cannot be numbred amongſt beleivers. As appeareth in their private diſcourſes, publick diſputes and printed bookes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. To Libertines and Familiſts it giveth offence and hardneth them in their diſorderly courſe, ſeing they can partake of the outward priviledges of the Church as well as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, without ſubmiſſion to the order &amp; government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whereunto the members are ſubject. The ſame may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of all diſorderly perſons that are obſtinate in evill courſes.</p>

                  </note>Fifthly. Ignorant and ſuperſtitious perſons are ſtrengthened in a ſlight eſteeme of Baptiſme, and an Idolizing of the Lords ſupper, when they ſee that any, without difference, are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that, but care is taken that only thoſe that are approved are admitted to this; as if a fitnes were not as well required, in him that would partake of the blood of Chriſt, and of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes by it, in baptiſme, as in the Lords ſupper. For the ſame remiſſion of ſinnes is alike propounded in them boath.</p>
               <p>Sixthly. To thoſe of the Separation it giveth no ſmall offence, who, for this cauſe, complaine of <hi>the Dutch reformed Churches, as neither ſo true to their owne grounds as they aught</hi> (their practiſe being compared with their profeſſion) <hi>nor ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the dignity of the thing, whileſt they adminiſter the Sacrament of Baptiſme to the infants of ſuch as are not within the Covenant, nor have either parent a member of any Church.</hi> Though the more moderate of them doe profeſſe, that, <hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> this, <hi>they doe account them the true Churches of Chriſt, and both profeſſe, and practiſe communion with them in the holy things of God, what in them lyeth; their ſermons, ſuch of them frequent, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Dutch tongue, and the Sacraments they doe adminiſter to their knowne members, if, by occaſion, any of them be preſent with, them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:20023:87"/>
               <p>Seventhly, To diverſe others who feare God, &amp; heartily deſire to ſee the ordinances of Chriſt eſtabliſhed in their purity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auty &amp; are unfeignedly greived that any blemiſh ſhould be found in the reformed Churches, and truely wiſh for the proſperity &amp; perfection of them, &amp; have witneſſed againſt this diſorder in this place, as Dr. A. Mr. F. Mr. H. Mr. B. Mr. R. amongſt whom I, being called thereunto, doe not only reckon my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſelfe, but alſo can number others, not only Engliſh and French, but even of the Dutch alſo, who have ingenuouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their diſlike of it, upon occaſion of conference, which I have had with ſome of them. To winde up all in one bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
               <p>That which giveth offence to Iewes, Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſts; Libertines, obſtinate ſinners, ignorant and ſuperſtitious perſons Seperatiſts, and to diverſe others that feare God, is a ſinne.</p>
               <p>But to adminiſter baptiſme ſo promiſcuouſly, as that wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting requireth, giveth offence to all theſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore to adminiſter baptiſme ſo promiſcuouſly &amp;c. is a ſinne.</p>
               <p>

And not only ſo, but it juſtifyeth that errour, as Iſrael juſtifyed Samaria, by eſtabliſhing a worſe. For this practiſe ſeemeth to make baptiſme not ſo much as a profeſſion of true doctrine, or a noate of ſegre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from other ſects, whileſt it is appoynted to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred thus promiſcuouſly in Amſterdam (where people of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſects inhabite) to all infants that are preſented, though they make no other ſhew of profeſſion, then by ſaying, <hi>yae,</hi> or nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the head, when they underſtand not what is ſayd to them, being of a different language, and are allogether unknowne to the miniſter and to the Church.</p>

                     </note> becauſe his expoſition ſeemeth to be more cleare then many, in reference to the true ſtate of the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Pontificians and the Orthodox. We ſay, they are inſtruments (taking the name largely) becauſe God uſeth them in beſtowing grace upon us: ye we doe not meane that they are inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as our Adverſaries doe, as if God were ſo tyed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as not to conferr grace without them, as an artificer cannot make a bed, or bench, without a ſaw, or hatchet, nor that they are able to worke any thing of themſelves by any hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertue proper to them and inhaerent in them, as is in a medicine for procuring bodily health, but becauſe, in the right uſe of them, God worketh a nouriſhing and increaſing of grace. Therefore the Sacraments worke nothing by the thing done, no not in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. For infants are not therefore partakers of grace only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are baptiſed yet neither are they baptiſed in vaine, becauſe they are baptiſed, unto future fayth &amp; repentance, &amp; becauſe they are members of the Church, and holy by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore the ſigne of the Covenant is not to be denyed them.</q> Thus he witneſſeth againſt that efficacy that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palls aſcribe to the Sacrament, &amp; joyneth with theſe Churches in deſtroying it, according to the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. <hi>2.4.</hi> Rom. <hi>3.28</hi> Cap. <hi>4.3 4.6.10.</hi> Bell. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cr. bapt. lib. <hi>C</hi> p. <hi>5.</hi> Whittak: de bapt. cap. <hi>2.</hi> de neceſſ: bapt pag. <hi>237. 238.</hi>
                  </note> Scripture. But this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe ſeemeth to build it up againe. For, whereas our Divines ſay that baptiſme is profaned, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is adminiſtred to the uncleane the popiſh wrighters tell us, that baptiſme is not thereby profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that it doeth ſanctifye them. <q>And, upon this ground, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine ſayth, that baptiſme may be given to thoſe that pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne not to Chriſt. To whom Dr. Whittaker anſwereth. This were true, if Baptiſme were a phyſicall cauſe of grace: For grace is not profaned when it is given to the uncleane, but it ſanctifyeth them, to whom it is given: elſe (he demandeth of Bellermine) why may not infidells of yeares be baptiſed, if they will ſuffer themſelves to be baptiſed; yea though they ſhould profeſſe that they doe not beleive in Chriſt, if baptiſme will ſanctifye them? But all men deny that. And why ſo? Becauſe they belong not to Chriſt: Therefore (ſayth he) Baptiſme aught not to be given to any that are not in Chriſt.</q> I will not enlarge this point, by ſpeaking of the ignorant conceit of ſome, that

               <p>But this practiſe doth build it up againe, when they, not only adminiſter this Sacrament promiſcuouſly to all that are brought, but alſo plead for it by ſome of the Arguments which Eraſtus produced againſt that.</p>
               <p>For, Firſt Eraſtus alleadgeth Iohns admitting the very worſt men to his baptiſme, viz, the Phariſes and Sadduces: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto both Beza and Mr. Cartwright anſwer, to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as I did ſome with whom I argued againſt this cuſtom, that Iohn admitted none to his baptiſme, but thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed repentance and amendment of life. Therefore they are ſaid <hi>to be baptiſed of Iohn in Iordan, confeſſing their ſinnes,</hi> which,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.4 5.</note> after the manner of the Hebrewes, ſignifyeth more then a bare acknowledgment that they were ſinners, even a profeſſion of their imbracing the doctrine of remiſſion of ſinnes by Chriſt,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20023:90"/> and a promiſe of amendment.<note place="margin">

As for the Phariſes and Sadduces (ſayth Mr, Cartwright) which came in Hypocriſy to be baptiſed, deriding the grace of God, I utterly deny that Iohn baptiſed them: yea, that he rejected them, it is evident by his ſharpe reprehenſion and terrible threatning of them with death and cutting off. Thoſe that pretended repentance in words he admoniſhed, that, if they would be baptiſed, they muſt bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, elſe they ſhould be cut off.</p>

Bezaes anſwer to him, in that caſe, may ſerve theſe in this caſe, out of whom (and a learned Commentatour upon that place joyned together with him) 2 things may be anſwered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the things, there ſpoken of, were not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt thoſe things which are onely Sacraments: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were Sacraments, in a ſenſe, yet they were not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in that ſignification of the the word [Sacraments] which is uſually amongſt Divines, when they call circumciſion, and the paſſover, Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper, Sacraments: for they were not by any ſolemne promulgation, expreſſed in the word, inſtituted &amp; ſanctified by God to be ſeales of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to beleivers (as circumciſion &amp;c.) which is neceſſary to the conſtitution of a Sacrament. But as they were miraculous and admirable types of Chriſt, ſo they were common, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall benefites ſerving for the bodily refreſhing and ſafety of the people of Iſrael in generall, and therefore that all, even the moſt unworthy of them, partaked of thoſe, it was for a peculiar reaſon, which hath not place in the Sacraments. For the ſhadow of the cloud covering the wholl army, as a ſheild, or buckler, received, and kept from them the beames of the ſun, which elſe in, that dry and hot region, might have conſumed them
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20023:90"/> with burning heate, eſpecially they being wearyed, and faint with journying, therefore it was neceſſary, that it ſhould be common to them all. The ſame reaſon might be given for their paſſing through the ſea, to eſcape the rage of the tyrant that purſued them. But what is this to Baptiſme?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the perſons there ſpoken of were the Church of Iſrael, whom he calleth <hi>our fathers,</hi> becauſe from them the Jewes ſprang which were the viſible Church of God, whoſe children alſo the Corinthians and all the viſible Churches of beleivers are amongſt the Gentiles, who have received from them the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the word, Sacraments, Covenant, and other ſpirituall good things, as their inheritance. But what are theſe to thoſe Libertines and others, who caſt off all communion whith the Churches of Chriſt? To conclude this Argument in one Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme,</p>
               <p>To build againe thoſe errours which the doctrine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of theſe Churches, according to the Scripture, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, is a ſinne.</p>
               <p>But this practiſe of promiſcuous baptiſing all that are brought, with out difference, buildeth againe thoſe errours, which the Doctrine and profeſſion of theſe Churches, according to the Scriptures, have deſtroyed, as appeareth in thoſe ſix particulars.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>Some good actions of holy men in Scripture are examples of Chriſtian liberty, others are patternes of Chriſtian duety: examples of this latter ſort be, 1. ſuch as are backed with ſome Divine praecept. So Sarahs obedience to Abraham is ſet forth as a patterne unto her daughters,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6</note> 2. ſuch as are held forth in the firſt inſtitution of an ordinance. Thus our Saviour argueth the ſinfullnes of Polygamy, as an abberration from the example or patterne of the firſt inſtitution,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.9</note> 
                     <hi>from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not ſo.</hi> Hitherto belong ſundry precedents ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, in the Acts of the Apoſtles, for guiding Church matters &amp;c. Yet here alſo this caution would be obſerved, that, in the firſt inſtitution or celebration of an ordinance, ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were accidentall, and taken up upon ſpeciall occaſions, &amp; ſuch actions are not precedents, vnleſſe it be upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: other actions are part of the inſtitution (whether eſſentiall or circumſtantiall parts) and belong, either to the compleatnes, or to the comlines of it, and theſe may not be neglected without ſinne, 3. of the lawfull actions of holy men, in Scripture, ſome were civill, and of thoſe there is more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (as not needing an exact rule from Scripture, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the light of civill prudence for a guide) others are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred as belonging to ſpirituall things, and ſerving to ſpirituall ends. And of theſe, ſome of them are varying, not alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in one conſtant tenour, in Scripture (as the geſtures in prayer, preaching, and the places thereof, any of which are alike imitable) others of them are conſtant, alwayes the ſame, and therefore ſtand as a cloud of witneſſes requiring our imitation.</q> The iſſue of all which is, that thoſe examples which are backed with ſome divine precept, or which are held
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20023:91"/> forth in the firſt inſtitution of an ordinance, being part of the inſtitution, or which were the conſtant lawfull actions of holy men in Scriptures, not, civill but ſacred, ſo bind us to imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that, not to conforme thereunto is a ſinne.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, it is evident that promiſcuous baptiſing in that manner as that wrighting requireth, if it ſwerve from ſuch good cuſtoms of the Church, and examples of holy men in Scripture, will be found to be a ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this practiſe agreeth not with the good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes and practiſes of the Churches of Chriſt will appeare, if we examine the ſtory of times from the firſt inſtitution of this ordinance.</p>
               <p>Firſt in the Iewiſh Church, circumciſion (whereunto Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me anſwereth, being a Sacrament of the ſame uſe that it was of) was, by Gods appointment,<note place="margin">

So that, to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any others, who were not of that ſeed to whom this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant belonged, was a ſinne. And therefore the holy fathers were carefull to follow this rule in keeping this ſigne joyned with the covenant in thoſe whom they circumciſed.<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>3.6.7.</hi> &amp;c. Mark. <hi>1.4.5.</hi> &amp;c. Luke <hi>3.3.16.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards Iohn Baptiſt walked in the ſame ſtepps, and by the ſame rule, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> adminiſtred Baptiſme in that Church whereof he was a member, requiring of all that came to his baptiſme a profeſſion of repentance and amendment of life for remiſſion of ſinnes, whereof Baptiſme was the ſeale, &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſt unto them.</p>
               <p>This ordinance our Lord Chriſt, after his reſurrection, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed to continue in the Chriſtian Churches, giving a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his diſciples to preach the Goſpell to the Gentiles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16 15.16.</note> &amp; to gather Churches amongſt them, and to baptiſe all ſuch as ſhould beleive, throughout the world, as a teſtimony to them that the righteouſnes of fayth did belong to them alſo, and not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20023:92"/> to the Church of the Iewes only.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.37.38.39.40.41 42.44.46 47.</note> Accordingly the Apoſtles &amp; ſervants of Chriſt were carefull to obſerve this rule in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring baptiſme. Thus Peter when he ſaw thoſe 3000 ſoules pricked in their hearts, preached unto them concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, remiſſion of ſinnes, Chriſt, the promiſe, baptiſme, fayth, and amendment of life, <hi>baptiſed thoſe that gladly received his word,</hi> and teſtifyed the ſame by joyning together in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof.</p>

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 9.11 13.14.15 16.17.</note> and their receiving the word of God, and therefore it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>when they beleived Phillip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Ieſus Chriſt, they were baptiſed, both men, and woemen.</hi> when Ananias was comanded to goe and baptiſe Paul, he objected againſt it at firſt, till the Lord aſſured him that he was one to whom that ſeale of the covenant belonged,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 10 43.44.47 48.</note> and then he went, and did it. When Peter, and thoſe that came with him, ſawe that the Holy Ghoaſt fell on Cornelius, and thoſe that were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at that time in his houſe, whileſt he ſpake theſe words, <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe,</hi>

                  <hi>that thorough the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, whoſoever beleiveth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> Peter demanded, <hi>Can any man forbid water that theſe ſhould not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, which have received the Holy Ghoaſt as well as we?</hi> And then they were baptiſed. To conclude this catalogue, Phillip did not baptiſe the Eunuch, though he deſired it, till he had given him ſatisfaction by profeſſing his fayth in expreſſe words, nor Paul the Iaylour and his houſe-hold, till it appeared unto him that they beleived on the Lord Ieſus. Nor is there any example in the Scripture varying from this courſe, to warrant ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous adminiſtration of baptiſme in a place where ſuch heterogeneall mixtures are of people of all ſorts &amp; ſects, as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam is,</p>
               <p>In the times after the firſt Century what care was taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perſons whom they admitted to baptiſme! The ſtoryes are cleare concerning thoſe that were <hi>adulti,</hi> though we find litle or nothing concerning infants, only that they were
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20023:92"/> baptiſed, by vertue of that right they had to it, in their belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parents. But that which we find concerning the courſe which they tooke with thoſe of yeares, may ſerve to ſhew their high eſteeme of this ordinance, and how farr they were from this promiſcuous manner of adminiſtring it, though we purpoſe not to examine, whether the firſt ſimplicity uſed by the Apoſtles was in all things obſerved by them, nor how exactly they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the rule in every particular. They divided thoſe that were turned from Gentiliſme to imbrace the Chriſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into three ſorts, whom they diſtinguiſhed by ſeverall names. 1. Whileſt they were to be catechiſed and inſtructed in the grounds of Chriſtan Religion, they were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>Audientes. Catechumeniſts</hi> &amp; <hi>hearers.</hi> 2. Afterwards, having bene compeleatly inſtructed, and earneſtly now deſiring to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sacrament, they were called <hi>Competentes, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.</hi> 3. Being found meet, they were baptiſed, and then, and not before, they were called <hi>fideles,</hi> and <hi>perfecti, perfect,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers,</hi> viz, in reſpect of the outward ſtate and order of the Church, with reference to thoſe degrees whereby they muſt come to be baptiſed. And when they did baptiſe them, a publick tryall was made of their fitnes (which aftertimes called <hi>Scrutinium,</hi> the Scrutiny) and hereof there were two parts, 1. an abrenunciation, 2. a profeſſion of fayth. 1. The abrenunciation was expreſſed by the party deſiring Baptiſme ſolemnly, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words, in the Greeke Churches. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And this part they accounted of ſo much importance, as that, without it, either in word or deed expreſſed, they accounted none fit to be baptiſed. 2. The profeſſion of the fayth was openly made, and in the hearing of the people, by him that deſired baptiſme, ſome times in a continued ſpeech, but more frequently by way of Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and by certaine articles.<note place="margin">Ambroſ: de Sacram lib. <hi>2.

Credo.</hi> This cuſtom at firſt inſtituted for, and uſed only by thoſe of yeares, who being converted from Gentiliſme to Chriſtianity deſired baptiſme, was, in aftertimes applyed to the baptiſme of infants, whoſe ſuretyes anſwered for

                  </note> This came in by abuſe (ſayth Beza) and giveth too much advantage to the Anabaptiſts. For, if baptiſme may not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, without a profeſſion of fayth preſent, in the infant (which if they meane not, why is the infant aſked concerning its fayth, in the ſuretyes, at that time, ſayth he) why ſtay we not with the Anabaptiſts (which God forbid!) till the child can profeſſe its owne fayth.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>As Chriſme and exorciſme, although ancient, are well abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, we would deſire alſo, that not only ſuperfluous, but alſo unfit queſtions were omitted alſo, although Auguſtine, in a certaine epiſtle, would excuſe it, with a certaine interpretation,</hi> but he calleth it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmum commentum,</hi> and that fitly. And therefore the practiſe of thoſe Churches, in putting the queſtion to the father of the child is more ſuitable to the rule; becauſe, in the Covenant which God maketh with the parents the right of the infant to baptiſme is founded, and the power and care of educating the child in that fayth lyeth upon them. To let paſſe this digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The cuſtom of thoſe times concerning men of yeares, though it doe not, every way, touch the caſe of infants, yet it ſheweth the piety of thoſe times, and the judgment of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients concerning the point in queſtion, <hi>de ſuſcipientibus bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And howſoever, in thoſe times, ſome ſuperſtitious rites were uſed in baptiſme, and ſome errours in Doctrine are to be found concerning the abſolute neceſſity of baptiſme to ſalvation, yet not one of them, ſo farr as my ſmall reading hath inabled me to diſcover, defended ſuch a promiſcuous admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it (as that wrighting of the five Miniſters required) as neceſſary or lawfull.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20023:93"/> them at all, being conſidered in Cyprians intendment, in that epiſtle, which was, to anſwer Fidus who held that infants of two or three dayes old ought not to be baptiſed, arguing from Circumciſion, which was not adminiſtred till the eight day, and from the bodily uncleanenes of infants at that age. Cyprian, in anſwer to his firſt Argument, ſheweth him that Circumciſion was a ſhadow, which is now vaniſhed, and, in anſwer to the ſecond, uſed thoſe words, Acts 10.15. and concludeth thus. <hi>Si etiam graviſſimis delictoribus &amp;c. If remiſſion of ſinnes be given to the moſt greivous ſinners, when they afterwards beleive, and, repent, and baptiſme is not denyed to them, how much more ought it not to be denyed ſuch infants.</hi> They that know how ſtreight Cyprian was in nullifying the baptiſme of thoſe who had bene baptiſed by haereticks, and ſuch as were out of the Church, cannot imagine that any helpe may be expected from him, for warranting the adminiſtring of baptiſme to their infants, who are out of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now if any thinck that there is ſome colour for the juſtifying of this courſe to be found in the capitulation of Charles King of Sycily, with the Sarazens,<note place="margin">Speed. Chron: lib. <hi>9.</hi> cap. <hi>10.</hi> in the life of Edw. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> at the ſeidge of Tunis in Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, the third Article whereof was that <hi>ſuch as were willing might freely receive the Sacrament of Baptiſme.</hi> Let him underſtand that that agreement was only to eſtabliſh the free excerciſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, not to warrant promiſcuous baptiſing, which was not, at all, in queſtion at that time. Thus the records of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times are againſt this diſorderly cuſtom, and concerning the judgment of later times, ſince the reformation, if enough have not bene ſaid already, more ſhall be added, in anſweare to the <hi>ſeventh pretence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only that I may omitt nothing, that I meet with in my reading, which may ſeeme to carry any colour of favouring that cuſtom, though but in the letter, I have produced thoſe two inſtances of former times, and will now add to them two or three of latter times. In whom I purpoſe not to examine or cenſure their expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions, but onely to ſhew that this evill cuſtom is not maintained, nor to be defended by what they have written.</p>
               <p>Firſt. I will beginne with that queſtion which excerciſed the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20023:94"/> Miniſters that met in the Claſſis at Neocomum.<note place="margin">Beza epiſt. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Whether the infants of excommunicates, are to be baptiſed, and in whoſe fayth, ſeing their parents are not members of the Church?</hi> The occaſion whereof was this. A certayne man, of a very wicked life, having 4 baſtards, and thriſe deceived the Church with hypocriticall confeſſion, and promiſes, was excommunicated together with his harlot. The queſtion was, whether the fourth baſtard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten after their excommunication, ſhould be baptiſed?</p>
               <p>The Miniſters of that Claſſis declared their judgment, which they ſent in a letter to Beza, thus, <hi>we are of opinion that the infant being borne of ſuch deſperate parents, is not included in the promiſe of bleſſing, and therefore ſhould not be baptiſed till it come to that age, wherein it may make profeſſion of its owne fayth, unleſſe the parents, returning againe to God by true repentance, be againe received into the boſome of the Church, or it be preſented by certaine godly perſons, who will bind themſelves by promiſe to performe the duety of parents to the child. Vnleſſe perhaps, becauſe it is borne within the Church, it ſhould be baptiſed for the fayth of the Church.</hi> Thus they.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt:</hi> 10.</note>Beza, wrighting to them his judgment in this matter, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth thoſe who are not to be accounted members of the Church into fowre ſorts farr different one from another. To omit the former three, as being not in queſtion, the fourth ſort is of <hi>thoſe, who being elect of God, and ingrafted into Chriſt, yet fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling through infirmity, and giving offence unto others, are delivered unto Sathan, that godly ſorrow may worke in them repentance.</hi> Of this laſt ſort, ſayth he, is the queſtion: Concerning whom he firſt ſuppoſeth diverſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are ſuch of whom we may judge in charity, that their eſtate is not deſperate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That though they are great ſinners, yet they are not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates which forſake the Church, nor joyne themſelves with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaryes in perſecuting the truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſome difference is to be made betweene Turkes and excommunicate Chriſtians, or Papiſts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is hard to judge, whether infants belong to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in reſpect of their firſt parents profeſſion, or not.</p>
               <p>Secondly. Vpon theſe ſuppoſitions he concludeth that <hi>the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20023:94"/> infants of excummunicates that remaine in the Church may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be denied baptiſme.</hi> But this he delivereth with two provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes, or caveats. 1. <hi>That, a fit ſurety bind himſelfe to the Church for the holy education of the child.</hi> 2. <hi>That, upon this occaſion, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter doe, at that time, ſeriouſly exhort the father, being preſent, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, in the preſence of the Church, before he baptiſe the child,</hi> Which he ſayth was frequently done in their Churches, viz, in Geneva. Thus he. Concerning whoſe anſwer I will propound two or three conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt. Though Beza was a very Reverend &amp; judicious Divine, yet, in matters of faith, it is not ſafe, <hi>vllius jurare in verba magiſtri,</hi> to reſt upon the authority of any man, without a warrant from the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly. Compare what was alleadged out of Beza himſelfe in my 1. Reaſon, in this Section, with this paſſage, and what Mr Cartwright anſwereth to ſome part of this, in the ſame Section, &amp; the Reader will ſee that it may eaſily be declared that this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence will not helpe the Advocates for promiſcuous baptizing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. Conſider the ſtate of the queſtion, as Beza maketh it, and it will appeare that the infants, for whoſe Baptiſme he pleadeth, are of ſuch as we may rationally judge to <hi>be ingrafted into Chriſt, and elect of God, only being fallen by infirmity, are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto Sathan, that godly ſorrow may worke in them repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is this for the juſtifying of a promiſcuous admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Baptiſme to all that are offered, in ſuch a place as Amſterdam, concerning many of whom we can not rationally have any ſuch perſuaſion?</p>
               <p>Fourthly. The foure things ſuppoſed by Beza, as caſes, wherein he dare not give liberty of baptiſing, ſerve to diſcover the evill of this cuſtom, whereunto that wrighting would have bound me. For, if all that are preſented, though they refuſe to make knowne before, who, or what they are, muſt be received, may not the infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of many, whoſe caſe is deſperate in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, who are, not only Apoſtates from it, but perſecutors: yea even the children of Iewes, Mores, and others, ſuch like, without the parents conſent be offered to baptiſme,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20023:95"/> and ſo be baptiſed, which were to profane the Sacrament, 2. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how timerouſly Beza expreſſeth himſelfe about the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, on whom the right of the infant to baptiſme dependeth, in this caſe, whereby it may ſeeme that he was not fully cleare in it himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly. The cautions and proviſoes, which Beza giveth to be obſerved, in the baptiſing of ſuch children of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, as he there ſpeaketh of, doe ſtrongly condemne the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that place, where the father is ſo farr from being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed publickly of his ſinne, that he is not ſo much as knowne, or inquired after, and where they are ſo farr from taking care for the holy education of the child, that they regard not by whom it is preſented, nor what becommeth of it afterwards.</p>

Ames commeth next to be conſidered, and a paſſage in his booke of caſes to be examined, leaſt ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, others willfully wreſt it to the countenancing of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which to be farr from his meaning, himſelfe doeth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declare, in the ſame place. For he ſo expreſſeth his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the baptiſme of diverſe ſorts of infants there mentioned, as it may appeare that his judgment was againſt promiſcuous baptiſing all that are brought, according to the controverted cuſtom: which I demonſtrate thus.</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20023:95"/> 
                  <hi>Becauſe, Baptiſme is the ſeale of the covenant.</hi> But who knoweth not, that many people are in Amſterdam, who are not in the Church, but out of it, in many reſpects? yet none muſt be refuſed that are preſented to Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. He ſuppoſeth that <hi>thoſe, whoſe parents are unknowne, are in charity to be accounted Chriſtians, when there is not juſt cauſe of preſuming the contrary.</hi> But, howſoever this might carry ſome ſhew of reaſon with it, in ſuch places where all the inhabitants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe religion, and are joyned to ſome Church, yet in ſuch a place as Amſterdam, how can a man preſume otherwiſe then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of many that may be offered to Baptiſme?</p>
               <p>Fourthly. He profeſſeth that a <hi>difference muſt be put betweene the infants of thoſe, who, in ſome ſort, by profeſſion, belong to the Church, yet doe openly breake the covenant of God, and the children of others,</hi> in the manner of <hi>their admittance to Baptiſme.</hi> viz, that, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort, <hi>what is required by the Covenant, and wanting in them muſt be ſupplyed by others.</hi> And for this he giveth two Reaſons. 1. Becauſe <hi>a diſtinction muſt be obſerved in all holy things betweene the cleane and uncleane.</hi> 2. Becauſe <hi>elſe the ordinances of God cannot be preſerved from all pollution.</hi> For theſe reaſons he doeth not allow the Baptiſme of excommunicates, unleſſe they have fit ſuretyes to undertake for their education, nor of baſtards, unleſſe their parents have profeſſed their repentance, or other godly perſons will take upon them the care of their education; nor of papiſts, unleſſe they be preſented by fit ſuretyes, who have power over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for theire education. But is any ſuch care taken, any ſuch courſe obſerved, about the admiſſion of ſuch to Baptiſme, in Amſterdam?</p>
               <p>Thirdly. Mr. Atterſoll, ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe of times,<note place="margin">Of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram: of Bapt. <hi>2.</hi> booke. ch. <hi>6</hi>
                  </note> whom the Reader may ſuſpect to favour this cuſtom, if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be not noated by us to prevent miſtakes. Now, howſoever he may ſeeme to be ſome what large in his judgement this way, and to yeeld more then, either Mr. Beza, or Dr. Ames have done in this point, &amp;, it may be, more then himſelfe would have done, if he had fully underſtood the diſorder againſt which we teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye; yet the limitations and cautions which he propoundeth doe diſcover the evill of that practiſe, concerning which the preſent queſtion is.</p>

In the caſe of the children of impaenitent perſons he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, two things without which his plea for their Baptiſme falleth. 1. That they are ſo borne in the Church, and of it, that the Church may be ſaid to be, as it were, their Mother. 2. That they are in the Covenant, in regard of their Elders, of whom they diſcend, as the Iewes were in Abraham, though their next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were wicked.</p>

Doe they enquire whether the infant was borne in the Church, of what parents, or forefathers, or how the ſuretyes will undertake to educate the child in that faith? To conclude, that all miſunderſtanding of Mr. Atterſoll may be prevented, let the Reader conſider one or two concluſions by the ſame Authour in the ſame chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">P. 211.</note>1. Concluſ. That, beſides the joyning of the word to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne, there is neceſſarily required a fit perſon to be partaker of the Sacrament,</p>

Apply theſe concluſions to this cuſtom, againſt which we plead, &amp; it will be granted, that what ever may ſeeme to an unwary Reader, in the ſlight and ſuperficiall reading of that paſſage in his booke, yet indeed it doeth not ſerve to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye the practiſe, about which the queſtion is. From the premiſes I argue thus.</p>
               <p>If ſuch a promiſcuous adminiſtration of baptiſme as the wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>Therefore it is unlawfull.</p>
               <p>So much ſhall ſuffice for declaring the grounds, whereupon I refuſed this cuſtom.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Anſ:] This conceſſion of the five Miniſters, which is uſed for a pretence againſt me, is really and indeed much againſt themſelves. For.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their judgment is, that I ſhould be left free, in any other caſe, to order my practiſe in admitting infants to baptiſme, by the advice of the Engliſh preſbytery, without requiring the counſail of the Claſſis, or obſerving, the cuſtom of that place therein. If ſo, why not in this caſe alſo? The caſe whereat I ſtuck, was to be free not to baptiſe thoſe infants, whoſe parents, being no members of that Church, are altogether unknowne. For which purpoſe I inſiſted upon this demand (which I ſtill thinck to be aequall, and, in that place, neceſſary) that none ſuch ſhould preſent their children in publick to be baptiſed by me, till I had before received ſatiſfaction concerning them, by private conference with them, or otherwiſe. Yet, to prevent all offence, I freely offered, in any difficult caſe that might fall out, to acquaint the Engliſh preſbytery with it, and to ſeeke their adviſe.</p>
               <p>Now, if my demand, about being ſatiſfyed concerning the parents and preſenters, be judged by thoſe five learned and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men fit to be granted, in any other caſe, why not in this caſe? Let the difference be ſhewen betweene other caſes and this, in reference to my demand. Will they ſay, this caſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready determined? Let them ſhew where. If they ſay in the Scripture; Let them alleadge one text from the firſt of Geneſis to the laſt of the Revelations for it. If they ſay, in ſome Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Synod of theſe Countryes; Let them name the Synod, and produce the Canon, in any one Synod that hath bene from the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20023:99"/> beginning of Reformation to this day. Jf they cannot, as it is certaine they cannot, where then? If they ſay in the Claſſis; It will concerne the Claſſis to ſhew, 1, by what right they take upon them to limit the Churches in ſuch caſes, wherein the Scriptures and the Synods have left them at liberty, 2. How this commeth to be ſo particularly and ſeverely preſſed upon the Miniſters of the Engliſh Church, ſeing no more is required of the Miniſters of any other Church, by the Claſſicall orders, then to ſubſcribe to the Catechiſme, and to the Belgick Confeſſion, and to the laſt Synod of Dort, but no ſuch practiſe is taught or defended in any one of theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This further may be collected out of the conceſſion of theſe five Miniſters, that the judgment of the Engliſh preſbytery is ſufficient, in ſome caſes which may fall out and cauſe doubts in the Miniſter about baptizing ſome that are brought, and that in thoſe caſes it is to be heard and reſted in, if it can be obtayned, without the judgment of the Claſſis, which the Miniſter is not bound to ſeeke, but when it is needfull, through his not obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the other. Herein they contradict the Anſwerer, who concludeth the Elders to be inſufficient for this, and that,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 23. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 6.</note> not by <hi>a common inſufficiency that is in all men for holy adminiſtrations</hi> 1. Cor. 2.16. but by a ſpeciall inſufficiency in caſes of this nature. Which is the rather to be obſerved, becauſe there he ſayth that the Claſſis hath already judged and determined it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are inſufficient: but here he ſayth, the five Miniſters have referred me to the judgment of the Engliſh preſbytery, &amp; elſewhere he ſayth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>that this wrighting of the five Miniſters was by all the miniſters of the Claſſis, with one conſent, approved and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> If this be ſo; then the Claſſis have not judged the Elders to be inſufficient in caſes of this nature. Thus he may be found not only contradicted by the Claſſis, but alſo contradictory to himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This alſo is implyed in this expreſſion of the five Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that, if the judgment of the preſbytery cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, and ſo it be needfull to ſeeke the judgment of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, that then it ſhould be heard and reſted in, ſo farr as the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſbytery ſhould have bene reſted in, if it could
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20023:100"/> have bene obtained. So farr, I ſay. For, the Anſwerer ſayth, <hi>there are caſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>wherin their judgment muſt not be reſted in, but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt be brought to the Claſſis.</hi> Whereunto I add, that there are caſes, wherein we muſt not reſt in the determination of Claſſes, or Synods, but appeale to the Scriptures, as to the higheſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory, and therefore are alike bound to reſt in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the preſbytery, and of the Claſſis, that is, in neither of them, further then they agree with the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When they add, that <hi>the judgment of the Claſſis is to be ſaught,</hi> in caſe of neceſſity, <hi>ſo farr as it may be done conveniently,</hi> they ſuppoſe truely, that the caſe may be ſuch, as it cannot be done conveniently, or at all done, when a Miniſter is put upon it ſuddenly. For even whileſt he is in the pulpit, the child is brought, many times: where ſhall he find the Claſſis, at ſuch a time, when he can not have time ſo much as to adviſe with the Elders that ſit before him, without making ſome publick diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance? which very conſideration ſerveth to declare the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablenes of my demand for private ſatiſfaction to be given me before hand, to prevent all publick diſturbance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This ſeeming conceſſion is merely ſeeming, and it is contradictory to it ſelfe. For 1, if there are caſes, wherein the judgment of the Elders will be requiſite and neceſſary; why doe they hinder me from the uſe of meanes to find out thoſe cauſes, when they bind me to baptiſe thoſe that are brought, though I have no knowledge of them, by private conference, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? 2. If that way of <hi>having ſome precedent private examination of the parents &amp; ſuretyes in Chriſtian Religion be ſo greatly approved by them,</hi> that they <hi>doe judge that this fore ſaid examination be orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo farr as may ſtand with the aedification of the Engliſh Church:</hi> why doe they afterwards add, that <hi>if the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or ſuretyes ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to come, &amp; undergoe this examination, or thoſe that doe come, ſhall not ſeeme, for that time, to ſatiſfye the brethren &amp;c. yet the infant &amp;c. ſhall not therefore be excluded from baptiſme, or deprived thereof.</hi> This is that which the Satyre could not underſtand, that a man ſhould warme his hands and coole his pottage with the ſame blaſt of breath, nor can I ſee how, by the ſame men, in the ſame wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

               <p>Anſ: 1. I doe eaſily beleive that the Dutch Miniſters did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire my ſetling there, and that, when they went to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer, their purpoſe was to further it. And I am perſwaded of them, that when they wrote to me, they did it, upon ſome incouraging intimations ſuggeſted by the Anſwerer, that a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from them ſignifying the concurrence and conſent of theire judgment with him in this point would prevaile to draw me to yeeld to it. I am alſo confident, they were the more apt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch courſes of accommodation, as, they ſaw, would beſt pleaſe him, vpon a conceit that the Anſwerer himſelfe did much deſire me, which alſo themſelves did intimate in the wrighting ſubſcribed by them. So that their miſcarrage in this buiſenes was not from any diſaffection to me, or deſire of hindring my ſettling there, but from too much credulity and tractablenes to complye with the Anſwerer, in his way, the iſſue of whoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20023:102"/> they foreſaw not. Theſe things being premiſed, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew the reaſon, why I could not reſt in their conuſaile, in this particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Two things, eſpecially, hindred me from reſting therein. 1. Becauſe the ſame thing which they propounded, only as their private judgment, the Anſwered preſſed as a law to me, wherein I muſt <hi>reſt,</hi> that is, conforme thereunto, and this my reſting therein muſt be the condition, whereupon he would conſent to my ſetling there, elſe not. So that his finger was heavyer upon me, in this, then their loynes, &amp; he aſſumed a power to himſelfe of preſcribing rules to me, which the government of theſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hath not given him, yea, more then is given to the Claſſes themſelves by any Synod, or to any Synod by the word of God, to injoyne this thing to a Miniſter as a condition of his call to a paſtorall charge. 2. Becauſe the five Miniſters propounded their private judgment nakedly without ſhewing their grounds from the Scripture, ſo that they ſeemed to me to deale by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, not by argument. Now the mere authority, that is, the bare affirmation of godly and learned men, is leſſe to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then their reaſons, and yet their reaſons, without the word, are of no value, in Divine matters. For <hi>all men are lyars,</hi> apt to be deceived, and ſo to deceive, impoſſibility of erring being proper to the Scriptures, which therefore are only fit to be the Canon or rule for the ordering of Miniſters concerning their wholl behaviour <hi>in the houſe of God.</hi>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20023:102"/> therefore their judgments muſt be tryed, and judged by it, and no further be reſted in, then they agree with it. According to that of Ierom <hi>Quod ex Scripturâ non habet authoritatem câadem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate contemnitur, quâ acceptatur.</hi>

And, how can that be called the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe Reformed Churches, which agreeth not with the doctrine of theſe reformed Churches?</p>
               <p>Secondly, oppoſe the Canons of the Synods of theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes to this cuſtom, and the thing will be manifeſted. In a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20023:103"/> Synod held at Dort in the yeare 1578. Art. 59. It was <hi>referred to the judgment of the Miniſters and Elders, whether there be any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cauſe brought by any, why the child to be baptiſed ſhould be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Baptiſme:</hi> and in Art. 61. It was ordered, that <hi>the fathers, before they bring their children to baptiſme, ſhall goe to the Miniſter, or an Elder, that the Church may have notice of the partyes that are to be baptiſed.</hi> And in Art. 62. They are appoynted to <hi>acquaint the Miniſter what name they will give the child, and to ſhew him how they will educate the child in that Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a Synod held at Middleborough in the yeare 1581. the 22. queſtion. It is demanded, <hi>whether the parents of children doe goe firſt to the Miniſter, or Elders, and certify them, that they deſire to have their children baptiſed before, to ſee whether they judge it meet to receive ſuch witneſſes or not?</hi> In Art. 75. It is queſtioned, <hi>whether the Miniſter ſhould be rebuked, when he baptiſeth children, whoſe parents appoynt witneſſes, which ſtand not for religion?</hi> Anſ. <hi>The parents ſhall be wonted, as much as is poſſible, that they firſt ſpeake with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters before they preſent their children to baptiſme,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In a Synod held at Vtricht, in the yeare 1590. Art 1. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that <hi>Baptiſme is to be adminiſtred, according to the ordinance of Chriſt, without Godfathers to bind themſelves, only the father and mother to promiſe to trayne it up in the Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, compare the Canons of theſe Synods with the cuſtom of that place, and they will be found ſo farr to varye from it, that it will appeare not to be the order of theſe reformed Churches, but a diſorder crept in, as we have ſaid before.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this examination of pretences uſed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this unwarrantable cuſtom with the judicious cenſure of Dr. Ames, who knew well the miſcarriage of this diſorder, in theſe countryes.<note place="margin">De con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:20023:103"/> five Miniſters, that is, to conforme to the cuſtom of this place in adminiſtring Baptiſme promiſcuouſly to all that are preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and by whomſoever.</p>

               <head>The Anſwer to the <hi>13.</hi> Section exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Of the order agreed upon in the Conſiſtory.</head>
               <p>THat which here, he calleth an order, will, upon examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be found very farr from accommodating me. <q>I will wright it downe as I received it from the Elders, out of the noate, which I have in keeping. Ian. 19. 1634. The Conſiſtory being gathered, Elders, and Deacons together, it was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whether that all perſons being no members ſhould be ſent unto Mr. D. to deſire the baptiſme of their children, and to make confeſſion to him, for his ſatiſfaction in his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Sacrament? The anſwer was by all voyces, yea, if Mr. D. can be perſuaded thereunto. And for the better, and more convenient bringing of the parents or preſenters of the children to the Miniſter, it is agreed, by moſt voyces in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, that Th: A. the <hi>Coſter</hi> ſhall bring or direct the partyes to the Miniſters houſe.</q> 
                  <q>Afterward, this queſtion was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Anſwerer, &amp; written downe in theſe words. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if perſons ignorant, being willing to receive inſtruction, allthough not preſently able to render a reaſon, ſhall be ſent away by him, or admitted, to witt, they approving of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of baptiſme taught in theſe Churches, and as by us uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is propounded?</q> A Copy of this pretended order, with the queſtionw, as brought to me by ſome of the Elders to ſee what anſwer J would make to them boath. Which when I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I found the order too ſhort, and the queſtion captious.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the order J let theſe five things be duely weighed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Anſwerer dateth this order Ian. 15. which the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20023:104"/> date Ian: 19. as he dated the miniſters wrighting to me Ian: 28. which themſelves, in their latine copy to me, dated Ian: 20. which difference is not of much conſequence, only it ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that it is not ſafe for the Reader to be too confident of the Anſwerers memory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where as I propounded three wayes of accommodation (as the eleventh Section ſheweth) here is but one of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Conſiſtory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That one is otherwiſe propounded then I expreſſed it. For I did not deſire <hi>that all,</hi> whoſe children ſhould be preſented to baptiſme, <hi>ſhould be ſent to me,</hi> but only that it ſhould be ſo, when it fell into my courſe to adminiſter that Sacrament (my motion being that we might not performe it joyntly, but ſeverally, and <hi>alternis vicibus</hi>) neither did I require that they ſhould <hi>make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> to me, but that I might ſpeake with them, before they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them in publick, that I might have ſome knowledge of them, by private conference with them, to prevent publick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The courſe, whereupon they agreed for accommodation, was not ſufficient. For 1. many preſent their children to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme that acquaint not Th. A. with it before hand. The Anſwerer told me that they come many times in the ſermon time, no man having knowledge thereof before. How ſhall Tho: A. ſend ſuch to me? 2. They that doe acquaint him with their purpoſe of preſenting their children, what if they will not come to me, upon his perſuaſion? Who ſeeth not that I am, in ſuch caſes, and the like, as farr to ſeeke for accommodation, as if no order had bene made? I told the Elders that this would not be ſufficient, unleſſe it were added, that, no infants ſhould be preſented in publick to baptiſme, whoſe parents are not members of the Church, before the miniſter had received ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction concerning the parents, in private. To this purpoſe, I required that a firme order ſhould be made in the Conſiſtory, to ſecure me from further trouble about this point, which the Elders promiſed, and indeavoured to effect (as I was told) but the Anſwerer reſiſted it, refuſing his conſent thereunto, without the conſent of the Claſſis.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:20023:104"/>5. The <hi>offer</hi> which he pretended that <hi>he voluntarily made, for the inlarging of this order, and my further accommodation, to wit, that he would ſend to me thoſe parents, that ſhould come to him &amp;c. and ſo, departing from his right, he was content to referr the wholl worke of examination to my diſcretion,</hi> is a vaine boaſt of falſe liberality. For. 1. few, if any, come to him to advertiſe him thereof. 2. If he ſhould ſpeake to them, they would chuſe, and it, may be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, and make contention, if a firme order were not made to prevent it. 3. His referring of the wholl worke of examination to me, was caſt in for a pretence, to evade the firſt meane of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation propounded by me: and by the ſecond courſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 11.</note> which J propounded for accommodation alſo, it may appeare, that this offer was not for the accommodation which I deſired, but to hinder it rather.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the queſtion.] Any one may ſee, it was capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For. 1. Why doeth he ſpeake only of knowledge, when I would (as he knoweth) be ſatiſfyed concerning other things, as well as their knowledge? 2. Why doeth he ſpeake of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree of knowledge, ſo obſcurely and ſuſpiciouſly? 3. Why was this queſtion added to the order? Was it not to ſhew that the order ſhould no further ſtand, then he received ſatiſfaction in my anſwer to his queſtion? And hereby two things are manifeſted. 1. that the order was not abſolute, but conitionall, <hi>if I could be perſuaded thereunto.</hi> 2. that I did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this order, as ſufficient, as may further appeare in my diſlike of his queſtion, whereunto, if my anſwer had bene to his content, to what end did he procure the five Miniſters to ſigne that wrighting which was ſent to me afterwards, as him ſelfe confeſſeth in the beginning of this Section? It had bene ſuperfluous, and to no purpoſe, if the matter had bene before concluded amongſt our ſelves.</p>
               <p>For a Concluſion of this Section, to ſatiſfye the Reader that this was to be called rather a propoſition or motion about an order to be deliberated upon, then an order perfected by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, theſe Conſiderations may be added to what hath bene ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That with this pretended order a queſtion was joyned,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20023:105"/> and my anſwer to boath was required. This ſheweth that the order was not abſolute, but to be aſſented to by the Anſwerer, if my anſwer to his queſtion ſhould pleaſe him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That, in that order it is expreſly ſayd, <hi>[yea if Mr. D. can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated &amp;c.]</hi> which againe ſheweth, that it was no abſolute order but to ſtand, if I could be intreated &amp;c. So that this could not be called an order, till the Anſwerer had bene ſatiſfyed about myne anſwer to his queſtion, and till I had yeelded to what, by this order, ſhould be propounded to me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That, when the order was brought to me, though the word <hi>ſatiſfaction and content</hi> was ſpoken of by me, as a word fit to be in the order, yet I demanded how this could be done by that order, upon the reaſons before mentioned in my fifth proofe of the defectivenes of that order,</p>
               <p n="4">4. That, upon my miſlike of it, the order was left with me to peruſe, and to add what I thought requiſite, as it was fit it ſhould, ſeing the end of it, was my ſatiſfaction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That, before J had poliſhed and perfected that order, to my content, the letter of the five Miniſters was brought to me, which then put me out of hope, till the Elders againe promiſed me, the next day, that all ſhould be made well.</p>
               <p>As for theyr wrighting of this amongſt the Acts of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, whether it was only entred into a waſte booke, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe, for a record, J know not, let them looke to that amongſt themſelves, but what I have affirmed, I know to be true, in every particular.</p>

As untrue is his report, that then I ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent. To make that appeare, I will breifely relate the ſtory of that matter. On ſaturday, towards the evening, one of the Elders brought me that wrighting ſubſcribed by the five Miniſters, which when I had read, I told him what I thought, &amp; that I durſt not yeeld to it. Both he, at that time, &amp; the next day, after the fore noone Sermon (it being the Lords day) the other Elders prayed me not to ſhew my diſlike of that wrighting to the Anſwerer, fearing that he would make ill uſe of it, aſſuring me that all ſhould be made well, to my content. The ſame day, after the ſecond Sermon, the Anſwerer aſked me, if I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wrighting from the five Miniſters? whereunto when I anſwered affirmatively, he demanded of me, whether I did reſt therein? Being loath to give offence, I did rather evade, then anſwer the queſtion, by ſaying (not only, as he reporteth, <hi>that the Dutch miniſters had done what they could,</hi> but alſo) that <hi>the wrighters them ſelves did ſeeme not to require me to reſt in it (ſeing themſelves ſay, in theyre wrighting; that it is but theyre</hi> privatum judicium, <hi>private judgement) but rather that they would be well content that ſome order might be made in the Conſiſtory,</hi> as appeareth in the cloſe of their wrightingh, and accordingly I did thereunto referr my ſelfe. When the Elders, fearing the Anſwerers drift, in this diſcourſe, haſtned him into the Conſiſtory, one of them ſaying he knew my mind, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:20023:106"/> that he deſired to heare it from my ſelfe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when, upon my anſwer to him, they againe indeavoured to breake off our diſcourſe, he ſayd to them diſcontentedly, <hi>I perceive that he doeth not reſt in the wrighting of the five Miniſters, further then it maketh way for an order to be made in the Conſiſtory.</hi> When I charged the Anſwerer herewith, what replyed he? <hi>If this be true, it followes that he did conſent and reſt in that wrighting of the Miniſters.</hi> Is not this a ſtrange inference? Let us ſee how he proveth it? <hi>Seing this order</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>was made and confirmed in the Conſiſtory.</hi> I profeſſed my diſlike of that order which was made, as inſufficient, and the Elders thereupon promiſed that an order ſhould be made to my content, in this particular, to this order to be made I referred my ſelfe, reſting ſo farr in the wrighting of the five Miniſters, as it made way for the making of that order, which the Anſwerer had oppoſed formerly. And to this day, I could reſt ſo farr in that wrighting, if I had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of being joyned with him, from which I am very farr, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch experience of his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſpeaketh of my <hi>referring him for anſwer to Mr. W.</hi>] what likelihood was there in that, when I had given myne owne anſwer? I ſayd indeed Mr. W. knoweth my mind, and that I had given my anſwer to him. But what is that to this? And if Mr. W, miſunderſtanding me, did report matters other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then I my ſelfe had done to the Anſwerer himſelfe; who ſeeth not, that he ſhould have accounted that to be the anſwer; which I my ſelfe gave to himſelfe, not that which Mr. W. gave ſo farr differing from myne, if he gave any ſuch.</p>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20023:106"/> For. 1. he ſayth, in the beginning, that, <hi>upon my conſent to the wrighting of the five miniſters, conſidered with the order above mentioned, it was thereupon reſolved &amp;c.</hi> The untruth of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is manifeſted to the Reader in the two former Sections, 2. In the concluſion of this Section, he chargeth me with <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him, when I ſayd in my wrighting,</hi> to prove that he did not deſire to have me with him, <hi>that the conditions, whereunto he held me, ſhewed it to be ſo,</hi> and added, <hi>upon which termes, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have others, whom he hath no cauſe to deſire for Colleagues with him.

For the intercurrent reproachfull paſſages, the Reader may noate more then a good many. But I let theſe things paſſe, &amp; will relate the ſtory of this paſſage alſo, as it was. The Anſwerer (in all probability) by the helpe of this wrighting of the five Miniſter, thaught that he had me now faſt in his lurch, which way ſoever I reſolved upon. If I ſhould reſt in it; then the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was yeelded &amp; I had bound my ſelfe to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe promiſcuouſly all that ſhould be brought, according to their cuſtom: which I could not doe, without ſinne againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. If I ſhould refuſe to conforme thereunto; he had the five Miniſters now ingaged to aſſiſt him, both with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and with the Claſſis, to hinder my ſetling there. This ground-worke being thus layed, it was no hard matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to goe to either of them. Hereupon, at the intreaty of the Elders, he accompanyed them to the Burgomaſters, whom, when they made their addreſſe to them, they found prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with a falſe information, about the cauſe of my comming into thoſe countryes, concerning which they deſired to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfyed. For they had bene told that it was not for matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, but for ſome offence againſt the civill Magiſtrate. which when I underſtood, I deſired the Elders, that they would not proſecute their requeſt any further, till this matter were cleared. And, upon enquiry, what had bene ſayd on both ſides, I found that the Anſwerer was so farr from doing me full right
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20023:107"/> (in clearing my innocency, as he might have done, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the truth concerning the cauſe of my comming into theſe parts, by myne owne report to himſelfe, in private) that what he ſpake might ſeeme, rather to encreaſe, then remove the ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>The pretende cauſe of my trouble with the civill Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in England (as it appeared) was a pious worke, wherein I (with others more worthy) was intruſted, to witt, the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of impropriations, &amp; reſtoring of the meanes to the right uſe, the maintenance of faythfull and painfull miniſters, in thoſe places, where was moſt need. Wherein three other miniſters (whereof two were Doctors of Divinity) and fowre Lawyers (of which one was the Kings Serjant at Law) and five Citizens (of whom one was Lord Major of London, when I came thence) were <hi>truſtees</hi> with me, by the intreaty and appoyntment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſome whereof are at reſt, others are yet alive. The worke it ſelfe was applauded in that very order which was made in the Exchecquor againſt our proceeding in it: Our faithfullnes in diſcharging that truſt was teſtifyed by his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Atturney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall (who proſecuted the ſuite againſt us) upon his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our accounts, which we gave in, upon our oathes. I had no more cauſe to flye for feare of trouble about this, then the reſt, nor had they, or I any cauſe to withdraw our ſelves, at that time, when I came over. For the buiſenes was wholly ended before my departure. This objection being anſwered, and the informer himſelfe falling off from his report, the former motion, for their conſent to my calling to that miniſtry, was, without my knowledge, revived, by the Elders. Before the Burgomaſters had given their anſwer, they were informed by one or two of the Dutch miniſters, both concerning me, and concerning this difference: when the Elders againe wayted upon them for their anſwer, the Burgomaſters told them. 1. that they were ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed about the former report. 2. That they had received a very good report from one or two of the Dutch miniſters, with whom they had ſpeech, concerning me. 3. That the ſayd mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters had acquainted them with ſome difference, which had riſen about this cuſtom, and that J had now promiſed to joyne
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20023:107"/> with the Claſſis, and to conforme to the orders, and cuſtoms of the Dutch Church, and, in particular, in this their manner of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing all that are brought. And they concluded, in effect, in theſe words, <hi>we expect that he doe accordingly, and ſo you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in your choyſe.</hi> By this the Reader may perceive that matters were now ſo farr from being accommodated, that they were ſet in a worſe ſtate, then before. For now, not only the five Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but the Magiſtrates alſo were ingaged ſo farr in this matter, that they gave but a conditionall aſſent unto my calling, and had, upon miſinformation, made my conformity to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable cuſtom, the condition thereof. So that, how eaſily might he, who before abuſed the Magiſtrates with untrue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports about the cauſe of my coming over (to hinder my admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) by a malicious (though true) complaint of my not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that order, in ſome caſes, cauſe me to be ejected thence? Now a gapp was opened to every one, that hereafter ſhould ſeeke my hurt, to procure ſome ſuch children to be brought (of which ſort there can be no want, at any time, in ſuch a citty as Amſterdam) as they know I dare not baptiſe, that thereupon they might ground a complaint againſt me to the Magiſtrate. Nor could I, in ſuch a caſe, expect any helpe from the Anſwerer, whom I have found an hinderer of my accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hitherto, both in thoſe three wayes propounded by me, &amp; in the order, which ſhould have bene made in the Conſiſtory, by the promiſe and endeavours of the Elders.</p>

               <head>An examination of his anſvver to the 16. Section, concerning their going to the Claſsis to ſeeke their conſent.</head>
               <p>THe truth of this paſſage I will breifely relate. After the Elders had received this anſwer from the Magiſtrate; out of their deſire to accompliſh the buiſenes (and not finding me at home when they came to ſpeake with me) they went, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20023:108"/> my conſent, or knowledge, to one of the Dutch miniſters, whom they intreated to call an extraordinary Claſſis to meet on the munday following, fearing (as it ſeemeth) leaſt longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes might occaſion new troubles. The miniſter, having gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their requeſt, in their returne homewards from him, they told me what they had done, about the calling of a Claſſis, I, being yet ignorant of the iſſue of their treaty with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, deſired to know what concluſion they had made, and the very words, wherein they had expreſſed their conſent, which when I underſtood, I told them that matters were now in a worſe ſtate then before: they alſo apprehended my reaſon. I wiſhed that the calling of a Claſſis had bene forborne, and prayed them to returne to the miniſter, from whom they came, and to wiſh him not to call an extraordinary Claſſis, for this matter, and to tell him that, upon ſome conſiderations, they are willing that matters reſt as they are, till the ordinary time ſhould come. They promiſed ſo to doe, and went from me with that reſolution, but another of the Elders, with whom they mett afterwards, altered their purpoſe, and therefore they went not. This change of their mind I knew not, till it was too late to helpe it. The day when the Claſſis mett, they were with me, in the morning, before they went to the meeting. I prayed them to deale plainly with the Claſſis, in telling them my judgment in this queſtion, and told them the danger of neglecting ſo to doe. They promiſed me, and purpoſed to doe ſo, but perceiving that the Miniſters of the Claſſis gave conſent to my call, without interpoſing any queſtion about my conformity to this cuſtom, they did not performe their promiſe, ſtill hoping and purpoſing to ſecure and ſatiſfye me by an effectuall order that ſhould be made for that end, in the Conſiſtory. Whereas the Anſwerer ſayth, that the Miniſters, at that time, underſtood from them, that I had declared my conſent with them, I am informed by the Elders, that, not one word was ſpoken, to them, at that time, thereabout. whereas he ſayth, <hi>Had I knowne that he was unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to accord with us, and to goe on in the ſame practiſe with us, I would never have made ſuch a propoſition for his admiſſion, as I did, in the Claſſis.</hi> J anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:20023:108"/>1. Had he ſaid ſo to me, at firſt, much trouble might have bene prevented, but he held me in expectation of a better end, by telling me that he would ſee what he could doe with the Claſſis, and that he would not anſwer me alone. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What propoſition he made I know not, but what oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he made, both concerning the tendring of a call to me in wrighting, and concerning the manner of expreſſing my call, both he knoweth, and others can teſtifye that were there preſent.</p>

               <head>The anſwer to the ſeaventeenth Section examined, concerning my withdrawing of my conſent firſt made knowne unto him, as is pretended.</head>
               <p>THe title of this Section ſuppoſeth. 1. that I had conſented, 2. that afterwards J with drew my conſent: the untruth of both which aſſertions hath bene ſhewen in the foregoing Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Here, he ſpeaketh of matters that paſſed betweene us the next Conſiſtory, after this meeting of the Claſſis. The ſtory whereof was thus. A wrighting, wherein the agreement of the Anſwerer with the officers of the Church about my calling, was delivered to me by the Anſwerer, &amp; Mr. A, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had read, I firſt gave them thanckes for this expreſſion of their good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of me, and then, to omit other paſſages, deſired to be certifyed, whether the order was made in the Conſiſtory which was promiſed. Whereby it appeareth that I ſtill expected that an order ſhould be made, more to my content then yet it had bene. For anſwer hereunto, the Anſwerer told me, that they could doe no more in that buiſenes, then had bene done formerly When I heard this, &amp; perceived, by a clauſe in that wrighting, that, in accepting this call, I ſhould bind my ſelfe to conforme to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20023:109"/> the orders and cuſtoms of the Dutch Church in this particular, as well as in others, I made ſome demurr indeed, and deſired time for deliberation, and being urged by the Anſwerer to a ſpeedy reſolution, I gave my anſwer to them in the Conſiſtory, in the end of the ſame weeke. But deſiring, &amp; obtayning ſecret conference with the Anſwerer, I acquainted him, in as inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive manner as I could, with my ſtill continuing unſatiſfyednes, about the lawfullnes of that conformity which was expected, praying him to helpe me with his adviſe, that my deſiſtance might be ſo ordered as might beſt conduce to the preventing of all diſturbance, and offence. He refuſed to give advice, ſaying he might doe nothing, of himſelfe, in that matter. To omitt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages, ſeing the Elders, and Deacons were now come together, we agreed to ſpeake with them in the Conſiſtory. As for his <hi>proceeding to haſten my calling, without delay,</hi> upon my ſuppoſed conſent; the examining of the former Sections, hath ſufficiently given light to the intelligent Reader, for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the vanity of this overture.</p>
               <p>But if any man thinck I made too ſtrict an interpretation of the words in that wrighting, which the Anſwerer calleth <hi>a forme of calling</hi> (becauſe, upon the reading of it; <hi>I made ſome demurr, deſiring time of deliberation</hi>) let him know that, if I had accepted the calling delivered to me in that forme, I had actually bound my ſelfe to conforme to that unwarrantable cuſtom. Nor is this my opinion alone, but the judgment of the Anſwerer, and (as he ſayth) of the Claſſis alſo, which will appeare by his owne words hereafter to be examined,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:20023:109"/>
               <p>So that, it is not only the judgment of the Anſwerer but of the Claſſis alſo. Nor was this Mr. B. caſe alone, to have ſuch an expoſition put upon thoſe words, in his <hi>forme of calling,</hi> but in the ſame ſenſe, the ſame <hi>forme</hi> was tendred me.

               <head>The anſwer to the 18. Section examined, concerning another Act of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for my ſatiſfaction.</head>
               <p>THe Anſwerer beginneth this Section with a miſreport of my withdrawing my conſent, which, he ſayth, I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given, whereas the truth is, that, from firſt to laſt, I was of the ſame judgment againſt this unwarrantable cuſtom, and ſo expreſſed my ſelfe, without any alteration.</p>
               <p>The paſſages in the Conſiſtory, the 11. of Feb. 1634. the Anſwerer reporteth ſome what diſorderly, in that he beginneth with that which was laſt, and maketh the teſtification of the Elders to follow that Act, which went before it, whereby the right underſtanding of things is hindred. For, after that private diſcourſe, before mentioned, had paſſed betweene him and me, and after ſome other ſpeeches in the Conſiſtory, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20023:110"/> after I had walked forth, at their intreaty, a great while, that they might privately conſult, being called in againe to heare the iſſue, whereunto matters were brought, I found that the order, ſpoken of in the 13. Section, was againe renewed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, with this addition, that <hi>the Elders and Deacons likewiſe promiſed to ſend ſuch to me as ſhould come to them.</hi> Which was as much as juſt nothing. For, the ſame objections which were made againſt the ſame offer made on the behalfe of the Anſwerer and of the Coſter, in the 13. Section, are of force againſt this alſo.</p>
               <p>Whereas he addeth, that, <hi>both he, and they promiſed to prevent all further occaſion of offence, ſo much as in them lay,</hi> had this bene done accordingly, the Elders might well have added, in way of <hi>teſtification,</hi> their perſuaſion, <hi>that no occaſion would befall to worke any ſcruple unto me in that which I feared.</hi> For, then the order which I deſired, had bene made to prevent further occaſion of offence, ſeing that lay in their power to doe, if the Anſwerer would have joyned with the Elders lovingly and freely therein, and no other courſe could helpe me, as the caſe now ſtood, which the Anſwerer knew, though the Elders and Deacons did not, all of them, ſee ſo farr into it. Now, ſeing this lay in them to doe, and yet they did it not, neither would the Anſwerer ſuffer it to be done, how was this promiſe performed of doing what lay in them?</p>
               <p>When I had ſpoken ſomewhat, to ſhew the inſufficiency of this order to ſecure me: they againe prayed me to walke forth, and, after a ſhorter abſence then before, they ſent for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to them, to heare what was added for perfecting that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which they wrote downe, in theſe words. <hi>And further we purpoſe if any ſhould at unawares, bring ſuch children, whoſe parents are not members, we ſhall deſire and counſaile them by the Coſter (without abſolute denyall) to bring their children the next excerciſe following, that, in the meane time, there may be conveniency of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon which Additionall I will noate ſome obſervations. 1. That the Elders and Deacons, did, in effect, revoke that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which was laſt ſpoken of. For, by their adding of this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:20023:110"/> to what was then done, it appeared that themſelves ſaw that the former order was not ſufficient to ſafeguard me from the thing that I feared. 2. That this Additionall is onely a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>purpoſe,</hi> but hath not the force of an order, 3. That, conſidering that they purpoſed onely to ſignifye ſo much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to thoſe perſons who ſhould at anytime ſo come (and not to have it publiſhed, that the wholl Church might take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it) and that by the <hi>Coſter,</hi> a meane man, whom they, to whom he ſhould ſpeake, would eaſily ſlight, and his commiſſion was only <hi>to deſire</hi> and <hi>counſaile them,</hi> which they would eaſily reject, and aſke him, what he had to doe to counſaile them to deferr the baptiſing of their children, In this caſe, what could he anſwer but this, J doe onely <hi>deſire and counſail</hi> you, but I may not abſolutely deny you? And, how can ſuch a courſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me?</p>
               <p>Here againe the Anſwerer miſreporteth my anſwer: for he affirmeth, that <hi>this would not content me, unleſſe there might have benean abſolute denyall of Baptiſme, in ſuch a caſe, if intreaty would not ſerve.</hi> But I made no ſuch Anſwer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any ſuch anſwer recorded in the Acts of that Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, which I have purpoſely examined. All that I ſtoode upon, was, that a firme order might be made in the Conſiſtory to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me from future trouble, about that matter. But this the Anſwerer would not permit to be done, though it might have bene done, without any offence to the Claſſis, and with much content to the Church. So that I have juſt cauſe <hi>to complaine of his want of brotherly moderation,</hi> in this point, what ſoever he ſeemed to yeeld, which, he knew, was not ſufficient to prevent the thing which I feared.</p>
               <p>The following paſſage is an unjuſt reproach, which I will paſſe by, having anſwered to the ſubſtance of it formerly. How unlawfull that practiſe is, and how neceſſary it was that I ſhould witneſſe againſt, it doth appeare in my Reply to his twelfth Section.</p>
               <p>In Concluſion. when the Elders prayed me to deferr my anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to another time, the Anſwerer told me, that, when I ſhould give myne anſwer, if I did accept of this calling, <hi>I muſt promiſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:20023:111"/> to reſt in,</hi> that is, to conforme to, the wrighting of the five Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Whereby it appeareth, that, not withſtanding all theſe pretences of accommodation, conformity to that wrighting, which bound me to this diſorder of promiſcuous baptizing, was, firſt and laſt, the condition, whereupon my calling to that miniſtry, muſt ſtand or fall, and that the Anſwerer would have it ſo. Thus that day paſſed.</p>
               <p>Now, though I had juſt cauſe of offence at theſe paſſages, yet, that it might appeare how much I was for peace and brotherly concord, the next day of their meeting, being the 15 of Feb. <q>I came into the Conſiſtory to give my anſwer, which was, that, if a promiſe muſt be made by me to conforme to the judgment of thoſe Miniſters ſet downe as an order for me to reſt in, I could not doe it, becauſe the promiſe of doing any thing is a Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the thing is lawfull to be done, which I doe not beleive to be ſo, in this caſe, yet, becauſe I much prized their loves and tendred their peace (as I truely told them) I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; if they deſired it, to goe on in aſſiſting the Anſwerer, as I formerly had done, for a convenient time, to ſee, if, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, by a freindly acquainting my ſelfe with the Dutch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, I might be ſatiſfyed about the lawfullnes of this cuſtom, whereunto my conformity was required, or procure that this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be layd downe, &amp; might underſtand what thoſe other orders &amp; cuſtoms of the Dutch Church are which I muſt obſerve, &amp; more fully know the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers &amp; ſtate of the Engliſh Church, wherwith I ſhould joyne.</q> In which motion I intended no intruſion (which I have alwayes abhorred, and was very farr from, in that place) but onely the peace and good of the Church. This the Elders apprehended to be very reaſonable, &amp; deſired that it might take effect, but the Anſwerer was otherwiſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as it is, in expreſſe words, by the Elders recorded in the Acts of that Conſiſtory.</p>

               <p>IN this Section we have the ſtory of paſſages concerning this buiſenes, in three Claſſes, and with the Magiſtrates.

But I come to the particulars.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To the firſt] The Reader, in conſidering the former Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will find that my judgment hath bene againſt this promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous baptizing, which the Anſwerer required, from the firſt to this inſtant, without any change.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond,] 1. It it is not to be expected that they ſhould reprove, or diſlike that wrighting, which was framed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their cuſtoms. 2. <q>If this be alleadged for the reproofe of my diſſenting from them, how eaſily can I reply that no Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of theſe Churches alloweth them to require this of me: but I will anſwer him, as Auguſtine doeth an Arrian, with whom he had to doe, ſaying, Neither may I alleadge the Councill of Nice, nor thou the Councill of Ariminum,<note place="margin">Contr. Max. Arr Cap. <hi>14</hi>
                     </note> thereby to prejudice one another, but by the Scriptures which are witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20023:112"/> to neither, but commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to boath, matter with matter, cauſe with cauſe, reaſon with reaſon ought to be debated.</q> But, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the five miniſters produced any ground from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to warrant their opinion or practiſe in this particular, not the Claſſis, to juſtifye their approbation, and confirmation thereof.</p>
               <p>To the third] 1. That is more fitly called <hi>a command,</hi> then <hi>a counſail,</hi> wherein a man is bound to reſt, and that under ſuch a paenalty. 2. Three Dutch Miniſters, being deputed to ſpeake with me, deſired to know what J diſliked, in that letter. I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered them, 1, that I diſliked the wholl drift of it, which is to deny me that liberty, in Holland, which the Dutch Churches have in England, by a grant of Edw: 6, to Iohannes a Laſco, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the broad ſeale of England, which is continued to this day. 2. I told them the danger of that expreſsion <hi>[quorum parentes, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceptor eſve]</hi> whereby I am required to baptize all infants, that are brought, if, either their parents, or ſuretyes are Chriſtians. For, by this rule, the children of Iewes, Turkes, and Pagans (of all ſorts) may be baptiſed, if a Chriſtian preſent them. Then, they ſeemed willing to alter that, and began to wright, but fell off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from their purpoſe, ſaying that they would acquaint the Claſsis with what I ſayd. And ſo the wrighting remaineth unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, in my hand, to this day.</p>
               <p>To the fourth,] If theſe two words, <hi>intreatyes and perſuaſions,</hi> ſignifye one and the ſame thing, without any difference in the ſenſe, I grant all to be true, which he ſayth, ſo that, to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of my accepting the call, it be added, <hi>upon the condition premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> But, if, by <hi>intreaty,</hi> he meane mere deſires, without arguments to worke upon my affections, and, by <hi>perſuaſions,</hi> he meane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatyes backed with arguments, to worke upon my judgment &amp; affections, then, I grant, <hi>intreatyes</hi> were uſed, but not <hi>perſuaſions:</hi> For I doe not remember one argument uſed by them to induce me, but rather a profeſſed declining thereof, ſaying that they came not to diſpute.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond Claſsicall meeting.] It is true, that then I ſent them a wrighting, by adviſe of one of the three mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters whom they deputed to ſpeake with me: the end thereof was
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:20023:112"/> to relate the truth concerning paſſages betweene the Anſwerer and me, to prevent and remove miſreports. 2. to perſuade them by reaſons, not to require it of me, as a condition of my calling, to reſt in that wrighting. 3. to acquaint them with my deſire of more time propounded by me to the Elders, and accepted by them; wherein had the Claſsis condiſcended to ſo aequall a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it might have bene much for the peace of the Church. I am certaine, I intended nothing elſe in it. But they were herein overſwayed by ſiniſter ſuggeſtions, ariſing from a jealouſy, that, if I had bene in, for a time, the deſire of the congregation would be more ſtrong towards me, where as my true purpoſe was, in that time, if J could not conforme to their orders, to order matters ſo, that they, who much deſired my ſetling there, might be willing to thinck upon ſome other, and my purpoſe was to have given the beſt helpe I could for the ſetling of ſome other, whom they ſhould deſire, in a way of peace and concord. To conclude. All that I aymed at, in that motion, was, either to accept their call, with ſatiſfaction to my conſcience, or to deſiſt, with the content of the members, that ſo no diſturbance might ariſe, for my ſake. As for the deputation here ſpoken of; the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters deputed, only againe prayed me to yeeld to that wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as before. There were two of the Elders preſent, at this time, with ſome others, witneſſes hereof. <q>From us they went to the Claſſis, and, the ſame afternoone, returned to me with this anſwer, or to this effect. That the Claſſis did judge that I had time enough already to underſtand the orders, and cuſtoms of the Dutch Church, and to ſatiſfye my ſelfe concerning the conformity required in that wrighting, yet they were content that I ſhould proceed in aſſiſting Mr. P. the moneth following, till the next Claſſis, but required of me, that if, in the meane ſpace, I could not yeeld, that I ſhould then deſiſt voluntarily, elſe they muſt be conſtrayned to complaine to the Magiſtrate.</q> Which meſſage I received in the preſence of diverſe witneſſes, and promiſed to doe accordingly. This J promiſed and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I confeſſe, only for the Churches peace, and myne owne, yet diſliking their injurious manner of proceeding, which I am content to paſſe by, with ſuch a touch, till further provocation.</p>

Had this Anſwerer bene of the ſame mind with them, to ſuppreſſe this treatiſe, as they did their wrighting (which, I beleive, was more in offencively penned) the adverſaryes might have wanted that cauſe of inſulting and reproaching us, for theſe contentions and jarrs, which now they ſeeme to have.</p>

               <p>THat the truth of this paſſage may appeare, the Reader may be pleaſed to underſtand, 1, that, after my deſiſtance from the publick worke, I would have returned to my owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but that it was now more unſafe and hazardous for me ſo to doe, then formerly, by a malicious and falſe report ſuggeſted againſt me in England, by one in Amſterdam (whoſe name I will conceale, for ſome reaſons, at this time) this audacious Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant was not aſhamed to informe that I had, in the pulpitt, rayled againſt the government of England, againſt which, the Anſwerer, and the wholl Church are able, and, I hope, ready to teſtifye for my innocency, in that particular: yea, any that have heard or knowne me, I thinck will undertake for me, that I am farr from rayling, at any time, much more in the pulpitt, and myne owne conſcience abundantly cleareth me thereof, in the ſight of God. Yet this report was too eaſily received, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon much bitternes, in terrifying menaces, was expreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, in publick audience. This I only mention to ſhew the cauſe of my ſtaying in theſe parts. 2. Being thus hindred from returning to England, my family alſo being with me in Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I was willing to be as proffitable, as I might, to others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving juſt offence to any. For this end, being requeſted by the Maſter of the family, where I ſojourned, I ſet a convenient time apart, every Lords day, about 5 a clock in the afternoone, (which was above an houre after the ſermon was ended in the Engliſh Church) to catechiſe boath our familyes, upon ſuch grounds of Divinity as I collected from the Scriptures, which I opened and applyed to them. To this excerciſe at firſt, few
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:20023:114"/> came, afterwards more coming to the knowledge of it, more reſorted: the greateſt number (for ought I have heard) which, at the moſt, have bene obſerved to be preſent at it, exceeded not 80 perſons. It is true, that, as the number increaſed, ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were provided for them to ſit upon, to ſave the chayres &amp; ſtooles from hurt. I had the leſſe cauſe of ſuſpicion, that this would be offencive, ſeing it hindred none from the publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which my ſelfe and all the reſt frequented conſtantly, and ſeing almoſt as great a number had reſorted to a like excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, at the ſame houre, in a private family, with the Anſwerers approbation, formerly. But now the caſe was altered, and the Anſwerer rayſed cauſeles jealouſyes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 21. <hi>line</hi> 14. 14</note> concerning this courſe, as if it had bene the beginning of ſome Sect. But moſt injuriouſly, as not only his owne pen declareth in the following Section, but alſo thoſe that heard can teſtifye, from the wholl ſcope of that exerciſe, which was to arme them againſt the danger of being carryed away by the errours of Sectaryes, and the open carriage of it, manifeſteth. For, not only the Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons would have ſhewed their diſlike, if any ſuch ſiniſter cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had bene attempted, as their place required, but alſo thoſe, who came as ſpyes (and we knew to be ſuch, yet excluded none) would have diſcloſed it to the Anſwerer, and divulged it to the world. Yea? and myne owne conſcience knoweth, that one mayne incouragement of my upholding that private excerciſe, was, that thereby a rent in the Church might be prevented, and the publick peace preſerved, whileſt the members were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what quieted and contented with that helpe, in private, which was denyed them in publick; and myne owne heart is privy to my intendments, at that time, of doing the beſt offices I could, for the quiet ſetling of a faythfull man, in the publick worke, if Gods providence ſhould offer one unto them, whileſt I ſtayed with them, that ſo peace and concord might be wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Paſtor and people, if it might be, before my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thence. This was my intent. And the event ſhewed that J was not wholly miſtaken in my conjecture, as will be evident to him that ſhall compare the carriage of matters, whileſt I lived among them, with the accidents that happened ſince. Yet,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20023:114"/> when I perceived that the Anſwerer tooke ſuch offence at this exerciſe, I deſiſted, before any ſpake with Mr. Wh: from the Claſſis, but with me none of them ever ſpake about it. Thus J may ſay with him in Ariſtophanes. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Anſ: 1. It is well that his pen doeth cleare me from inclining to Schyſme or Seperation, whoſe tongue hath unjuſtly rayſed ſuſpicions thereof againſt me in the minds of ſome. Yea, that his owne hand wrighting, in this Section,<note place="margin">

Who would thinck that, againſt ſo ample teſtimony, the Anſwerer ſhould have the boldnes to accuſe me ſo unjuſtly for that? 2. His accuſation of me for my journey out of the Citty, at that time, is as injurious, as that: For the caſe, which cauſed my travayle, at that time, would have conſtrained me thereunto, at any other time, as well as that, it being neceſſary, for the helpe of a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter, who, being very ill, craved my aſſiſtance, with much importunity. My wife accompanied me thither, and the Mrs. of the houſe where we lodged, was pleaſed to accompany my wife, being a ſtranger in theſe countryes (which I had no
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20023:115"/> cauſe to refuſe, but to take thanckfully) and, beſides her, not one member of the Church went along with us (unles the mayd, which attended her ſucking child be a member, which I thinck ſhe is not) Now, what was to be blamed in this? This the Reader ſhall ordinarily find, that the Anſwerers complaints, both againſt me and others, have no other roote but the evill ſurmiſes of his owne jealous fancy: pluck up that roote, and the moſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints will dye of themſelves.</p>

               <p>MY defence of Anſwering his untrue reports, in my wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and of having it in the hands of one or two freinds, that might ſpeake in the cauſe of the dumbe, &amp; maintaine myne innocency, in my abſence, the Reader ſhall find in my reply to the ſecond Section. Now, the cavills which are to be found in this Section againſt that wrighting are to be examined. Firſt. It is an injury to call that wrighting <hi>injurious</hi> which was a neceſſary declaration of the truth againſt ſlanders, which were, firſt ſecretly ſpread abroad by him, in private ſpeech, afterwards, by a large letter which he ſent to his frend at N. in England, &amp; now are by him ſcandalouſly publiſhed, not only againſt me <hi>(ego enim non ſum tanti)</hi> but againſt men of eminent worth and noate, both living and dead.</p>
               <p>Secondly. How juſtly that wrighting is called <hi>a true report of paſſages,</hi> the Reader will ſee, by comparing what is ſayd, on both ſides, and how unjuſtly he excepteth againſt that title.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. When I aſſured the Reader that this Engliſh copy is a true tranſlation out of the latine, by, <hi>this Engliſh copy,</hi> I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20023:116"/> not which is printed. For there are diverſe faults in that, &amp; it appeareth to have bene printed out of a very imperfect copy, but that which I wrote. As for his exception againſt it, <hi>that having twiſe uſed that odious phraſe</hi> [pro imperio] <hi>imperiouſly; in the ſecond place it is left out, in my tranſlation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Repl: The phraſe is but a true expreſſion of the thing, let the odious thing be mended, and the odious phraſe ſhall not be uſed. In the meane ſpace the expreſſion muſt be ſuitable to the action. For is it not <hi>[actus imperij]</hi> an imperious act, to deny a man convenient time for ſatiſfaction about a matter of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and to bind a man to obſerve cuſtoms and orders, without ſhewing the aequity thereof? Some would have called ſuch an act <hi>tyranny</hi> and ſo ſhall I, upon further provocation. 2. As the uſe of the phraſe is condemned, ſo the omitting of it once in the tranſlation is reproved. Forgive me that wrong. I thought he would ſee how unwilling I was to faſten their <hi>imperious</hi> dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with me, upon the Readers apprehenſion, by repeating the word <hi>imperiouſly</hi> againe. But let it ſtand, in this ſecond place alſo, ſeing the Anſwerer will have it ſo, and he ſhall find me, with Gods aſſiſtance, prove it to be a fit expreſſion. 3. Is my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation untrue, becauſe this word is once omitted? Let the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Reader judge, whether it be neceſſary to the truth of a tranſlation, that every latine word be rendred into Engliſh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when the ſenſe giveth it ſufficiently in the ſentence. If this be not to ſeeke a knott in a bulruſh, I know not what is.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. In my firſt wrighting how unable the Anſwerer is to diſcover any untruth (in my report of the private conference betweene us) the Reader will ſee by my examination of his Sect: 11. in my Reply, and will be further cleared hereafter.</p>
               <p>Fifthly. In my ſecond wrighting he ſeemeth to find <hi>a foule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth or falſification</hi> (after his uſuall manner of expreſsing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) both in the ſuperſcription, and ſubſcription thereof. But what is it? I ſayd that <hi>thoſe inſtructions were delivered by the Elders of the Engliſh Church deputed.</hi> But 1, that tranſlation ſayth not <hi>by the Elders,</hi> but <hi>to the Elders,</hi> and that both in the ſuperſcription and in the ſubſcription. Is it not ſtrange that he ſhould then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifye the tranſlation, when he complaineth, of falſification in the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20023:116"/> tranſlatour? 2. ſuppoſe it had bene <hi>to the Elders deputed,</hi> and that by <hi>Elders,</hi> I meant any lawfully deputed by the Elderſhip; yet I ſpake and wrote truely. For I left the wrighting with Mr. W. who was deputed before by the Elderſhip, (having alſo told Mr. Wh: of it) praying him to communicate it with the reſt, that one or two Elders that ſhould be deputed by the reſt, might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to the Claſſis, and, having reſpect unto that agreement with them, I uſed that expreſſion, before the meeting, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that it would have bene ſo ordered by them. Now, if no ſuch deputation was made afterwards, what is that to me, who ſtiled the Elder by that title which beſt expreſſed my purpoſe, and expectation? neither was I in towne to alter it afterwards, nor did I ever heare, that no deputation was made in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, till now.) The iſſue of all this deepe accuſation, what is it now, but, as when a great expectation was of the mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes birth, which was fained to be with child, after which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared but a litle mouſe running thence? How juſt the complaint is alſo of <hi>his want of brotherly moderation,</hi> I have noated in my reply to his Sect. 12.</p>
               <p>Sixtly. In that which he ſpeaketh concerning my third wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he multiplyeth injuries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In miſreporting my intent in the three wrightings, which was, not <hi>to make him odious to the Claſſis,</hi> nor <hi>to teach the Elders how to fill their mouthes with reproach of him,</hi> nor, <hi>to ſtirr up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the Congregation againſt him,</hi> but ingenuouſly and candidly to report the truth, whereunto I was called, and compelled, for the neceſſary clearing of my ſelfe, &amp; for the remove all, in ſome, and prevention, in others, of cauſeles praejudices, and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes, which already did, or, by my ſilence, might ariſe in their minds againſt me, by his ſuggeſtions: Would the wrighting of thoſe things, <hi>accuſe, undermine,</hi> and <hi>defame</hi> him? It is a ſigne that his cauſe is not very good. And, if my wrighting thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars be a fault, who is to blamed for it, but he who conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me thereunto?</p>
               <p n="2">2. In charging me with <hi>unjuſt uprayding of him, for myne aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of him, and with a vaine boaſting of my ſelfe.</hi> To convince him of ill requiting me, yea of rewarding evill for good, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20023:117"/> what labour and patience I had excerciſed for his and the Churches peace. This was no uprayding, much leſſe unjuſt, nor vaine boaſting, but a juſt declaration of the truth (the caſe requiring it) and a ſad complaint of his unthanckfullnes. How he hath anſwered it, will appeare in the examination of Sect. 2. 8. and 40. Whereunto as he referreth the Reader, ſo doe I, and alſo to Sect. 11. and 14. that it may appeare how juſtly I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the two injuryes which he noateth. Alſo concerning the five objections anſwered by me in that third wrighting I doe concurr with him in referring the Reader to the Sections mentioned by him, and examined by me.</p>

               <p>Seaventhly. In that which he addeth, upon the grant of this ſuppoſition, that he had not deſired me, diverſe things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. 1. His unjuſt accuſation of me (by way of intimation) <hi>as if I did quaraile and contend with him, becauſe he did not deſire me</hi>] whereas it is neither ſo, nor ſo. For neither was it my intent, in that wrighting, to quaraile, but to anſwer objections, nor did I blame him at all for not deſiring me (for he may uſe his liberty, for me, to place his deſires upon a more deſireable object) but for pretending his deſire to have me with him, when he did really hinder my ſetling there. 2. His Sarcaſticall inſultation, when he tauntingly demandeth, <hi>Is he ſuch a man of deſire &amp;c.</hi>]
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20023:117"/> Reply 1. It ſeemeth that I am not <hi>ſuch a man of deſire,</hi> in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, yet, in the eſteeme of that Church, and of the Claſsis, how unworthy ſoever I am in my ſelfe, it ſeemeth, I am; Elſe, how comes it to paſſe, that <hi>they</hi> account themſelves ſo injuried by his oppoſing and rejecting me (as appeareth in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints) and that <hi>theſe</hi> ſo much deſired that I might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the miniſtry of that Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect:</hi> 12.16.19.</note> as he hath formerly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed? 2. If I am not <hi>ſuch a man of deſire,</hi> in his account, yet J ſhould not be ſuch a man of ſcorne and contempt, to be ſo trampled upon in a ſtrange land, and expoſed to reproach, and that by a brother, and in print, whereby I am now become <hi>a man of ſorrowes,</hi> and that in many reſpects. 3. His voluntary conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or acknowledgment (by way of ſuppoſition and intimation) that he <hi>withheld his deſire from me, in the act of Election,</hi> is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. For, if, when his voyce went with the reſt for myne election, he withheld his deſire from me; how can it be thought, that he did at all deſire me? For did he give his vote for me? Did he ſubſcribe my call with his owne hand in that wrighting, whereof himſelfe was the penman? Did he himſelfe, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with one of the Elders, bring it to me, and pray me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it? And yet did he withhold his deſire from me, in the act of election? No marvayle then, if he held me ſo to this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No marvayle, that he refuſed the meanes propounded by me for accommodation. No marvayle, that he procured that wrighting of the five miniſters (howſoever by ſome of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in favour of me, they thincking that he ſaught to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate me, but) which he made uſe of to ſtrengthen himſelfe againſt me. No marvayle, that it was procured to be ratifyed by the Claſſis and Magiſtrates, that I ſhould reſt in it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thereunto. No marvayle, that an order which the Elders would have made in Conſiſtory, to ſecure me from trouble for that, was hindred by him, and that the convenient time, which they agreed upon to allow me, for ſatiſfaction, was denyed by him. No marvayle, that other uſages (which I forbeare to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) of me have bene ſo unbrotherly (that I ſay no more) if he did not deſire me. 4. Jn the ſame way of ſuppoſition and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation he ſeemeth to ſay, that he was <hi>for another whom he might
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20023:118"/> judge to be more lowly &amp;c.</hi> 1. This I complaine not of as an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to me, but I wiſh that he may both have ſuch an one to be with him, and may be ſuch an one himſelfe, as he there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, if he judge of theſe properties by a right rule. As for me: I ſhall account him the moſt <hi>lowly,</hi> who with moſt ſelfe-denyall takes upon him Chriſts yoake, and him moſt <hi>loving,</hi> whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cloſeth moſt ſtrongly with all good men, in all good wayes, and him to be moſt <hi>faythfull and upright,</hi> who doeth moſt <hi>excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelfe to have a conſcience in all things voyd of offence, both towards God, and towards man.</hi> In this ſenſe he might have had men lowly, loving, faythfull, and upright, whom the Church deſired, but injoy not, to their great greife, and loſſe, 2. It had bene more brotherly dealing to have admoniſhed me in private (if he had diſcerned any thing in me contrary to thoſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) rather then thus to traduce me in print, or, if he would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſuch accuſations, to have proved them to be juſt, and not thus, without proofe, to reproach me. 3. The five Reverend Dutch preachers did not apprehend him to have ſuch praejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt me, when they compoſed that wrighting which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath tranſlated, according to their words, and publiſhed, where ſpeaking of me, they ſay, <hi>whom,</hi> for diverſe reſpects there mentioned, <hi>we underſtand to be moſt deare unto Mr. P.</hi> It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth they were miſtaken in their opinion of the Anſwerers love to me, if his thoughts of me then were according to this wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. 4. Himſelfe ſubſcribed the wrighting wherein I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the miniſtry in that Church (which alſo was ſubſcribed by all the Elders and Deacons) wherein they thus expreſſe their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme of me, <hi>in the feare of God having conſidered of ſuch as might be fit thereunto, we have ſet our eyes upon you &amp;c. being perſuaded of your ſufficiency, learning, and piety, hoping alſo, that, through thoſe gifts of the ſpirit wherewith the Lord hath indued you, and wherein we have received much contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, you may be a ſpeciall inſtrument of building up the Church of God by your godly labours amongſt us.</hi> This wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was penned by himſelfe, and his owne name ſubſcribed with his owne hand, wherein my fitnes for that place is ſo teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, that it may ſeeme ſtrange how one &amp; the ſame man ſhould privatly wright that, and yet publiſh this.</p>

               <p>Eigthly. When he ſayth, <hi>It is certainely a want of modeſty and prudence in him, to make ſuch diſputes about his owne deſireablenes.</hi> Anſ: 1. I onely ſhew the reaſons of myne opinion that he did not deſire me, but of myne owne deſireablenes I doe not ſpeake at all, much leſſe diſpute. 2. Will any man condemne me for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that he ſhould deſire me, with whom I ſhould be joyned, as Colleague, in ſuch a worke? 3. What could I ſay leſſe, or more mildely? I did not ſay, he oppoſed me, rejected me, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented me, or the like, but only, he did not deſire me. 4. V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my uſe of the ſame word <hi>[certainly]</hi> in the ſecond Section he ſayd, <hi>it is againſt modeſty and conſcience, to pronounce ſo certainly touching the iſſue of things to come,</hi> and yet himſelfe uſeth the ſame confident aſſeveration in a caſe more improbable, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to any man, or to himſelfe, if he reduce his reaſoning and diſcourſe (to prove ſuch diſputes as I have uſed about myne owne deſireablenes, to be a want of modeſty or prudence) into a Syllogiſme.</p>

               <p>If it be a ſlander, it muſt needs be unjuſt: for no ſlander can be juſt.

But, if it be true; the Anſwerers ſinne is double: 1, that he gave juſt cauſe of this complaint, in a caſe, not of private, but of publick injury, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving of his flock, not of civill, but of ſpirituall liberties, to the violation of that order which Chriſt hath ſetled in the Church; 2.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly. In his fifth anſwer, he pretendeth juſt cauſe of his excepting againſt three of the Elders, as <hi>partiall,</hi> in this controverſy about me.

               <p>Theſe are new crimes, which former ages have not heard of, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and after times will wonder at, if all things be conſidered.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. Is it the ſinne of partiality, in the Elders, to hold with any man in diſliking, and witneſſing againſt evill cuſtoms, as this promiſcuous adminiſtration of baptiſme is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be? or to joyne, without ſcandall or Schyſme, in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate excerciſe, after the publick are ended? or to make an act for a mans preaching amongſt them as an aſſiſtant, the publick neceſſity requiring it, and the Church generally deſiring it, for a convenient time, that he might underſtand thoſe orders and cuſtoms of the Dutch Church, whereunto his conformity is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, before he bind himſelfe thereunto? If ſo; then to hold the truth, to joyne in a peaceable and inoffencive uſe of private helpes for aedifycation, and to provide for the publick good &amp; peace is an argument of partiality in an Elder. The vanity of this pretence is manifeſt. Let us ſee his ſecond proofe.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> To prove them partiall he produceth another conſideration. viz, that <hi>the Elders have made like complaints (as theſe Complainants) heretofore, of his bringing matters to the Claſſis violently, without their conſent. The Claſſis hath judged them parties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be it ſo. 1. Is not this alleadged againſt himſelfe? For, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> now it appeareth not to be the complaint of ſome members only, who might unjuſtly complaine, thorough ignorance or miſinforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but even, the Elders who are eye witneſſes of all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in Conſiſtory, have made the ſame complaint. Will not any man conclude, that matters are injuriouſly carried, indeed, when, not only ſome of the members, but the Elders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo complaine thereof? As for the Claſſis judging of them parties; how eaſily may the Elders demand their grounds, and proofe thereof, and, in caſe of want of ſufficient evidence, appeale from their ſentence, to the Scripture? And is it not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:20023:121"/> poſſible, may we thinck, to find partiality, as well in the Claſſis, as in the Conſiſtory? I wiſh they had expreſſed more aequanimity in the carriage of this buiſenes, for their owne, and the Churches ſake.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> Thirdly. If that proofe fayle, he hath one more, which will hold, as he imagineth. <hi>Euen the Elders themſelves have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, when ſome ſuch complaints as theſe have bene brought unto them, they had no power to judge thereof.</hi>

                  </label> The Anſwer of the Elders, which is here reported, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be underſtood as an acknowledgment of their want of power, <hi>de jure,</hi> by right, to judge thereof, but may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as a declaration (or rather a complaint) of their want of power, <hi>defacto,</hi> by other mens taking it out of their hands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out right. Now, if that power which belongeth to them be taken from them, without their conſent, and ſo before it be given, and without warrant of the word, and ſo before it be due: it is no partiality to aſſume that, by a due clayme, which was unduely withheld from them; and it is no preſumption in them, if, knowing their right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they give a new judgment of that thing, which they had formerly waved, not knowing that they had power to judge thereof. So much for his pretences againſt them for partiality.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> In his ſixth anſwer he undertaketh to ſhew their inſufficiency, wherein, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> that he be not miſtaken, <hi>he profeſſeth not to ſpeake of that common inſufficiency that is in all men &amp;c. but he excepteth againſt their inſufficiency in ſome ſpeciall caſes, and namely in ſuch particulars whatſoever have bene already judged and determined in the Claſſis.</hi>

                  </label> So then. Whatſoever the Claſſis ſhall take upon them to judge, though it were unduely and diſorderly brought to them, ſhall bind the Church ſo, as it muſt reſt therein, &amp; that they ſhall not meddle in it, though they are not ſatiſfyed about the aequity of their proceeding in it, and though they doe not ſhew ſufficient warrant from the word, for their judgment, and determination.

To me it is manifeſt, that no Nationall Synod, in theſe Countryes, ever gave power to the Claſſes thus farr to deprive particular Churches of the right of judging things proper to themſelves, within themſelves.

               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, the inſufficiency of his five an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in the 24. Section will be obvious to the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in particulars; thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt,] His thincking that the Elders erre in their judgment, in ſuch caſes as theſe in queſtion, is not a ſufficient ground of an appeale, as may appeare in reaſon: For ſo no cauſe ſhould be ended in their Conſiſtory, though the Elders unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in their judgment, if the Paſtor differ from them, out of an obſtinate will, without giving ſufficient reaſon of his diſſenting, and then, to what end are the meetings of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip? Whereas he calleth upon them to prove it by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they may, with better warrant, require him to prove by Scripture the lawfullnes of ſuch appeales, in ſuch caſes, for which they find no word commanding or approving them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the ſecond] Unleſſe he can prove thoſe agreements amongſt the Elders to be <hi>ſinnes, and unfruitfull workes of darkenes</hi> he will be found guilty of a double ſinne. 1. that he oppoſed the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20023:122"/> Elders, without juſt cauſe. 2. that he miſapplyeth Scripture to juſtifye his unjuſt oppoſition of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For the third] It is granted that, as Councills may erre, ſo may Conſiſtoryes much more eaſily, and that all obedience aught to be in the Lord. But, with all, that the proteſters againſt them, aught to declare the aequity of their ſo doing, from Scripture, or good reaſon, which hath not bene done by the Anſwerer.</p>
               <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. To the fifth] It is true, that the power of the Elders in government had not bene overthrowne by his bringing any matter unlawfully unto the Claſſis, if it were the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Claſſis, in ſuch caſes, to remitt the matter to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory againe. But, what one inſtance can he produce, in the particulars whereof they complaine, or in any other caſe brought by him to them, wherein the matter was remitted to the Conſiſtory: Why ſo? It was not becauſe the <hi>buiſeneſſes were ſo weighty that it hath bene agreed in the Synods that they ſhall not be proceeded in, without adviſe of the Claſſis;</hi> nor, becauſe <hi>they concerned many Churches, and therefore require the conſent of all</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:20023:123"/> What then? It was, <hi>becauſe the Elders could not ſatiſfye him, nor he them,</hi> as he intimateth in the anſwer before. But, why was he not ſatiſfyed? Becauſe he would not be ſatiſfyed, unleſſe the matter might be carryed according to his will. For, no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon was given by him againſt it, at that time. So then, if he will end a buiſenes in the Conſiſtory, there it ſhall be ended, but, if he ſee that it will be carryed againſt his mind there, it ſhall not be ended there, but be taken out of their hands and carryed to the Claſſis, where he knoweth how to bring his purpoſe about. Thus he hath two ſtrings to his bow. But, in the meane time, is not the power of the Elders in governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t overthrowne thereby?</p>

Section compared with what hath bene by me declared againſt the diſorder of promiſcuous bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing in the 12. Section.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He ſayth, <hi>If he had proteſted againſt ſuch an order &amp;c. Such a proteſt might have ſerved for a direction to the right uſe of their power but did not tend to the deſtruction thereof.]</hi> If it had bene a mere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his judgment, and reſolution, though delivered in forme of a proteſt, and had bene ſtrengthned with good reaſons, and had bene left to them to conſider of, it might have ſerved for a correction and direction to the right uſe of their power, without deſtroying it. But, when a peremptory and inflexible reſolution of oppoſing what they ſhall doe againſt his mind, in this matter, is held foorth, without arguments from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or good reaſon, to convince them of the aequity of that ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in oppoſing, and, when it is not left within themſelves, but carryed from them to the Claſſis, that, by the interpoſition of their power and authority, the Conſiſtory may be hindred from executing or making ſuch an order, who ſeeth not that, as, by the former, they have no direction from him about the right uſe of their power, ſo, by the latter, their power is deſtroyed, in this particular; which may be proved thus.</p>
               <p>That Act, whereby the Elders are hindred, that they can not provide for the godly, comely, and orderly adminiſtration of the Church, doeth deprive the Elders of their power in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the good of the Church.</p>
               <p>But this Act of the Anſwerer, in hindring the ending of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about baptiſme &amp;c. by interpoſing the authority of the Claſſis, for that end, was an hindring of them from providing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:20023:124"/> for the godly, comely, and orderly adminiſtration of the Church. Ergo.</p>
               <p>Which propoſition will he deny? The firſt? But that is taken from the nature of the Elders office, as hath bene ſhewne out of Scripture, and reaſon, before. And he knoweth it to be true.</p>
               <p>Will he deny the Aſſumption? That is proved by what I have ſhewen in the 12. Section againſt promiſcuous adminiſtration of baptiſme, as it is in that place, whence it will appeare to be not godly, nor comely, nor orderly, and therefore the Elders have power and are bound to provide that it be not done in that Church.</p>

                  </label> How unjuſt this chalenge is, may appeare, 1. By the report of the Elders themſelves, who ſay that it was referred to voyces, and by voyces agreed that I ſhould have a convenient time, and it was particularly expreſſed by one of the Elders, and not gainſayed by the reſt, that <hi>a yeares time,</hi> would be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for that purpoſe. 2. Not onely they, but the Anſwerer himſelfe ſayth as much, in effect. For in the 18. Section he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that <hi>I made this offer unto them, that, if the Conſiſtory deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, I would continue, as an aſſiſtant, in preaching, for a convenient time, that I might therein acquaint my ſelfe with the Dutch miniſters, the orders of the Claſſis, and Synod, and ſtate of this Congregation &amp;c. But, though our Elders liked of this offer,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>and thought good to deſire him to remaine with us, as an aſſiſtant, as is before ſayd; yet I thought it not ſafe</hi> (ſayth he, ſpeaking of himſelfe) <hi>without firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king adviſe of the Claſſis.</hi> Whereby it is manifeſt that the Elders liked of the offer, as it was made by me. But they knew that I was of opinion that leſſe then a yeares time could not be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, for thoſe purpoſes, and that I meant that time, when I
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:20023:124"/> ſpake of a convenient time: yet, if they had agreed that ſix moneths, or three monthes ſhould be judged a convenient time, I ſhould have reſted therein, which ſeing they did not, but liked of the offer as it was made by me, it ſeemeth, their purpoſe was to conclude for a yeares time.</p>
               <p>Secondly. In ſtead of anſwering,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> 2</note> he recriminateth thoſe that <hi>divulge the ſecret affayres of the Elderſhip, and that untruely.]</hi>

                  </label> The former reply ſheweth that the report is not untrue. And that the Elders have unlawfully divulged this, they put him to prove: for they deny that it is unlawfull to acquaint the members with paſſages of this nature, which are not to be kept ſecret in the Conſiſtory, when they tend to the injury of the wholl Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. His third anſwer is a mere evaſion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> 3</note> by putting off the fault from himſelfe upon the Claſſis, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Fourthly.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> 4</note> In his fourth anſwer he pretendeth to give reaſons for his carrying this matter into the Claſſis, which are not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but mere pretences.</p>
               <p>Firſt. That, <hi>whileſt matters were thus kept in ſuſpence, the cord of contention ſhould have bene drawne out, and lengthned.]</hi> But, who ſeeth not that this would have cut the cord of contention aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when a convenient time had bene given for the compoſing of things to a peaceable concluſion, and when the people ſhould ſee his regard of their deſire and content ſo far expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly. That, <hi>in the Conſiſtory where he hath moſt trouble, he ſhould have leaſt aſſiſtance.]</hi> But, by this courſe he would have leſſe trouble in the Conſiſtory, the ſpirits of men being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what quieted and contented. Beſides, I ſee not but he might have eſcaped many troubles there, if he had not made troubles, when he found them not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. That, <hi>in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme, in ſtead of an Aſſiſtant he ſhould have a Reſiſtant,]</hi> But, how could he be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant in Baptiſme, whoſe worke was only to aſſiſt in preaching, as myne ſhould have bene, if this agreement had ſtood. Againe, ſuppoſe, after the expiration of that convenient time, I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the paſtorall calling, how could I have bene a Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:20023:125"/> to him in Baptiſme, if, either the Dutch Miniſters could in that time, have convinced me of the lawfullnes of that cuſtom, (in which caſe, J ſhould have yeelded to it) or, if I could have procured the laying aſide of that queſtion, by their conſent with me in eſtabliſhing thoſe meanes which I propounded for accommodation?</p>
               <p>Fourthly. That, <hi>hereby the calling of another miniſter would be hindred.]</hi> But 1. the event ſheweth the contrary. For, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time, which the Elders would have given me, was but 12 moneths. Now, though, upon this pretence, the Anſwerer oppoſed that, yet thoſe 12 moneths were ſpent before they had any, and 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moneths more, before one was ſetled with them. 2. My purpoſe, in that propoſition, was, to worke, in that time, for the peaceable ſetling of any faithfull man, whom they ſhould make choyſe of, if I ſaw not greater likelihood of my comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſetling there, then hitherto had appeared. Wherein my true intent was to prevent the trouble, and procure the peace of the Church, as much as in me lay.</p>
               <p>The fifth pretenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is coincident with the fourth, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that.</p>
               <p>Sixtly. <hi>The Claſſis would have bene offended, which had formerly diſallowed ſuch an agreement about Mr. H.]</hi> But 1, conſider, as great a matter as this hath bene done there, without the leaue of the Claſſis, when the Anſwerer had a mind to it. Was not Mr. D, for a yeare and more, aſſiſtant to the Anſwerer in the ſame Church, in preaching, without leave or conſent of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis? 2. If the Claſſis would be offended for this, it would be an offence taken, but not given. For, what though they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſallowed ſuch an agreement of the Elders about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayning of M. Hook? May not the Church doe ſuch a thing without their allowance? What rule is tranſgreſſed thereby? If any: Let the Anſwerer ſhew it. If none; then the Claſſis diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that act, and would be offended at this cauſeleſly. 3. At moſt, this would have bene an offence but to the ſpirits of the Claſsis, who would have bene angry at it, as a neglect of them only; not as a ſinne againſt God. But the hindering of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, by their Paſtor, and the Claſsis, is an offence to the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:20023:125"/> conſciences of ſome of the Church, who are greived at it as a ſinne againſt God, both in the Paſtor and the Claſſsis, who have hereby ſtreightned the liberty, and weakened the power which Chriſt hath given the Church, in procuring ſuch ſpirituall helpes for their aedification, as they find proffitable, and deſire, with a generall conſent, eſpecially there being no danger of haereſy and ſchyſme, whereby themſelves or other Churches ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected thereby. Now, compare theſe two offences together, and it will appeare that the latter offence, in this caſe, was more carefully to be heeded and prevented then the former.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh, and laſt pretence is, that <hi>he eſteemed this agreement as an act of intruſion for me.]</hi> which he needed not to have feared, nor would have, by ſo injurious a courſe, prevented, if he had knowne me, as he might have done, by my wholl carriage in this buiſenes. Himſelfe reproacheth me for ſtanding ſo much upon his deſiring me, and now he feareth leaſt I had ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of intruding my ſelfe. How will theſe ſtand together? One while he telleth the Reader that I would not accept the call, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while, that I will not be diſmiſſed. A ſtrange caſe, that I am ſo averſe, that they can not get me in, and yet ſo intruding, that they cannot get me out. By this it may appeare that his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was much diſtempered by needles Iealouſyes, and groundles ſurmiſes, which, in theſe paſſages, have cauſed much diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelfe, and diſturbance to others.</p>
               <p>The 3. inſtance. And that it may appeare that I wrong him not, in ſaying thus, his owne words, about the third inſtance, which they bring to prove that he depriveth the Elders of their power in governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the good of the Church, declare the ſame. For, ſpeaking of Mr. Weld, whom they accuſed him for <hi>hindring from preaching, without leave of the Claſſis, though he profeſſed he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt him,</hi> he telleth the Complainants that he had ſome thing againſt Mr. Weld. If they deſire to know what, he readily telleth them, and all the world, that he had ſomething againſt <hi>his behaviour, in generall, which was an offence and trouble unto him.</hi> It had need to be ſome great matter, ſome will thinck, that ſo farr ſett him off from Mr. Weld, as he there intimateth To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all wondring at the matter, he roundly relates more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:20023:126"/> then one. But, if you come to examine them, they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be grounded upon needles jealouſyes, in his owne mind. For, his firſt diſlike was, becauſe <hi>Mr. Weld refuſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelfe, and to ſhew his opinion touching their preſent contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſyes.</hi> And, have not others carryed themſelves in the ſame manner, as well as he, which were greater ſtrangers to him, then Mr. Weld, being not of his nation, whom yet he hath, not only willingly received to preach, but alſo bene willing to have joyned with him in the paſtorall office. His ſecond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of Mr. Weld was, that he <hi>ſaw him moſt familiar with thoſe that were his cheifeſt oppoſites,</hi> So then, there was oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them before I came, and this oppoſition was rayſed to ſuch an height, that the Anſwerer accounted it a trouble and offence to him, that any miniſter ſhould be moſt familiar with thoſe whom he accounted his oppoſites; and, that, upon feare, leaſt Mr. Weld ſhould ſtrengthen and animate them againſt him, he was unwilling to have him preach. That this feare may not ſeeme altogether cauſeles, he telleth his Reader how <hi>Mr. H. preached againſt that in the afternoone, which he taught in the fore noone.</hi> The truth concerning this paſſage I have heard from diverſe witneſſes, and have ſeene the noates of boath their ſermons, as they were taken by thoſe that heard, and doe find (ſo farr as I can diſcerne, by what I have heard, or read) that the Anſwerer tooke offence at Mr. H: cauſeleſly for that, and that Mr. H. was called, and, in a manner, compelled to ſay what he did, at that time. But, that I may returne to Mr. W. was the Anſwerers feare of him retayned in his owne breaſt? No, he telleth us, in his ſecond anſwer, that he <hi>deſired the counſaile of the Dutch Conſiſtory</hi> about this matter, <hi>and their adviſe was that he ſhould bring it to the Claſſis.</hi> Thus the Anſwerer is troubled, the Dutch Conſiſtory is troubled, the Engliſh Church alſo is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and all about his feare of Mr. Weld. But, was this feare well grounded? was there ſufficient cauſe for it? Let himſelfe ſpeake, and he will tell us: yea, he hath already told us, in his third anſwer, that, <hi>upon further conference with Mr. W, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him a peaceable diſpoſition, and conceived, that he would not give offence by his preaching amongſt them.</hi> It is well that his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:20023:126" rendition="simple:additions"/> is rectifyed, at laſt, to perceive that which he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. That conference did not alter Mr. W: diſpoſition, but his owne perſuaſion of him: ſo that the change was in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer, not in M. W. As a man in a ſhip thincks that the ſhore moves from him, whereas the ſhip, wherein he is, is carryed from the ſhore: ſo a man, whoſe paſſions are diſturbed, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth every man to oppoſe him. When all was now quiet, what courſe tooke the Anſwerer? He telleth us, that <hi>he made the ſame knowne to the Claſſis; whereupon he was admitted to preach.</hi> And, why muſt this be made knowne to the Claſſis? Is it againſt the government of theſe Churches that a ſtranger, to whom the Anſwerer can impute no errour, and in whom <hi>he preceived a peaceable diſpoſition, and conceived that he would not giue offence by his preaching amongſt them,</hi> being deſired by the Church, ſhould be permitted to preach a ſermon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then the complaint is juſt, that the Elders are deprived of their power in government for the good of the Church: And ſeing, whileſt the Anſwerer ſeemed unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfyed; the Dutch Conſiſtory ſeemeth to apprehend it to be a caſe of ſome difficulty to permit M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Betwixt which and the imperfect combination of Churches, in and about Geneva, there is ſome difference. For <hi>that</hi> is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary conjunction of the ſmaller Churches with the greater, in one Conſiſtory, for their helpe in their particular Church buiſeneſſes (the ſmaller Churches wanting men fit for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadging of their Church affayres, and making one preſbytery,<note place="margin">Zanch. in <hi>4.</hi> praecept.</note> with the next greater Church, which, being better fitted, meete
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20023:128"/> weekely in their owne Conſiſtory, and theſe with them) But <hi>this</hi> is a combination which is betweene diverſe Churches, which, having their ſeverall preſbyteryes, or Conſiſtoryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, ſend their deputyes, viz, one Miniſter and one Elder, to meete with the like deputyes from all other Churches,<note place="margin">Synopſ: pur.

                  </note> in ſuch a Dioceſſe or diviſion, at a time, and place appoynted, to handle ſuch things as concerne many Churches in common, and as could not be ended in the Conſiſtoryes of the particular Churches. Concerning theſe the queſtion is, in this and the foll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owing Sections; for the diſcuſſion whereof I will propound two things to be conſidered, in <hi>theſi,</hi> or in generall. 1. What kind of combination that is which, is lawfull amongſt Churches? 2. What power that is which is due to them over particular Churches, by vertue of that combination?</p>
               <p>For the firſt. The combination of particular Churches, in Claſſes and Synods, is, either ſuch a conſociation of them as is betweene aequalls, or ſuch a ſubordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them as is betweene unaequalls. The firſt is by way of counſaile, or brotherly direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſecond is by way of command, or maſterly ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This we condemne, as being the firſt ſtep, whereby the Pope aſcended into <hi>the chayre of peſtilence,</hi> and a mere inlet for tyranny to invade and uſurpe the Churches right. The other is approved by the practiſe of the moſt ancient Churches and by good reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt. The practiſe of the Churches of the firſt age is cleare for a free ſeeking and communicating of mutuall helpe, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and meſſengers, as occaſion required, and that, not onely in Scripture<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  </note> And Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian expreſly declareth that the Churches, in his time, did give mutuall helpe to one another, <hi>ex charitate, non ex ſubjectione,</hi> in way of charity, not of ſubjection. And the Epitomatour of the Centuriſts fitly expreſſeth that combination which was, in thoſe primitive times, among the Churches, by the communion of the members in the body, and concludeth that thoſe actions and offices of their mutuall care, one for another, did not, <hi>ex imperio aut ſubjectione quâdam proficiſci, ſed ex charitate &amp; aedificandi ſtudio</hi> i. e. <hi>did not ariſe from any authority, which one did excerciſe over an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20023:128"/> ſubjecting it to the reſt, but out of love and indeavour of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall aedifying.</hi>

Parker hath ſaved me the labour of this taſke, by laying downe ſix Arguments, for the proofe of this, in thoſe his learned and elaborate treatiſes, <hi>concerning Eccleſiaſticall policy,</hi> as 1, From the <hi>ground</hi> of this combination of Churches,<note place="margin">Dc eccleſ. pol. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Cap. <hi>22.</hi> p. <hi>329.</hi>
                  </note> which is love, not obedience. 2. From the <hi>forme</hi> of it, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and conſociation &amp;c. 3. From the <hi>matter</hi> of it, which are Churches, who are aequall among themſelves, as members in the body, which have a viciſſitude of offices mutually to be performed, among themſelves. 4. From the <hi>object</hi> of it, which is <hi>res communis,</hi> that which concerneth all the Churches, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. 5. From the <hi>outward manner of proceeding,</hi> which is <hi>eollatione conciliorum,</hi> by conference and communication of counſells. 6. From the <hi>end</hi> of this combination, which is, not to receive the mandates of other Churches, but their conſent, counſail, and approbation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered, <hi>in theſi,</hi> is what power or authority that is which is due to Claſſes over particular Churches, by vertue of their combination.</p>
               <p>Firſt. More generally, This will beſt appeare by a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the nature of that kind of aſſocication or combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as it hath bene, in the words immediately preceding, expreſſed. For, anſwerable to thoſe two kinds of combination, there is a twofold power, in the perſons ſo combined, whereby they may juſtly doe ſuch things, which others cannot, who are not, by ſuch a relation, thereunto qualifyed. Thus, to the unae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall fellowſhip which is betweene ſuperious and inferiours (as parents and children, Maſters and ſervants Princes and people) appertayneth <hi>jus Rectorium,</hi> the power of government:<note place="margin">Hugo Grot de jure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, et belli. p. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> but to that other ſociety which is betweene aequalls (as brethren, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, freinds, confaederates) belongeth <hi>jus aequatorium,</hi> ſuch a power of communicating mutuall helpe as may ſtand with the preſervation of their ſeverall libertyes and mutuall aequality, ſafe and untouched. And no other power is due to them, <hi>quâ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:20023:129"/> If they aſſume any other, it is a mere uſurpation, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the bounds and limits of their combination.</p>
               <p>Secondly. More particularly, to apply this to Claſſes, which are ſociall combinations of many Churches, for mutuall helpe, it muſt be conſidered. 1. What is the object of this combination. 2. What power it hath, in reference to that object.</p>
               <p>Firſt. The object of claſſicall combinations of Churches is <hi>res communis.</hi> i. e. that which concerneth all the Churches, or many of them, in that diviſion, either of it ſelfe, or by accident. Beza declareth Synods to be neceſſary for 3 cauſes,<note place="margin">De triplic. Epiſt. pag. <hi>91. 9. 3.</hi>
                  </note> 1. to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve conſent. 2. to provide common remedyes, againſt common evills, by common counſail. 3. to helpe thoſe who thinck them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves injuryed by the judgment of particular preſbyteryes. The Synod of 3 nations in Can. 35 reduceth all to. 1. matters of doctrine. 2. matters of order, and eccleſiaſticall policy. 3. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular facts. To be breife, theſe things are matters, either of fayth, or of fact, whether brought to them, or obſerved by them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In matters of fayth, their reſolution is required, not their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, their counſayl, not their command, it being the end of the Churches combination, in ſuch matters, onely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their gifts in fellowſhip together, to find out the ſenſe of the Scripture more clearely and certainely, for the ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, then it could have bene done by any, apart from the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Matters of fact are, either common, or perſonall. Perſonall matters doe primarily belong to the particular Churches, and onely to them, ſo farr as they are proper, but, if, by accident, they become common, they fall under the deliberation of many Churches thus combined as <hi>in cauſâ lapſorum,</hi> in the cauſe of thoſe who fell off, in thoſe times of perſecution, not onely in ſome one, but in many Churches, for the diſcuſſion whereof, Cyprian and the Affrican Doctors alſo concluded,<note place="margin">Cypr. lib. <hi>1</hi> Epiſt. <hi>8.</hi> et lib. <hi>4.</hi> Epiſt <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meeting of many Churches was neceſſary, in a buiſenes ſo common and of ſo great conſequence, that the plaſter might be as broad as the ſore, and the remedy hold ſome proportion with the malady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. For the power it hath] That it may be diſtinctly underſtood what kind of power it is, which (in reference to the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20023:129"/> preſent queſtion) is due or undue to Claſſes, I will premiſe two or three diſtincttons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Diſt: Jt is not <hi>poteſtas originalis,</hi> but <hi>derivata</hi> i. e. it not a power which the Claſſis hath originally, in, and from it ſelfe, but which is borrowed and <hi>derived</hi> from others, viz, from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches. So that, as the conduit pipes can give no other water, then what themſelves received from the ſprings, nor the ſtarres any greater light, then is communicated to them from the Sun: ſo the Claſſes can excerciſe no other power over any particular Church, then that which it ſelfe hath freely given them. Hence it will follow, that the Claſſes have not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute but a limited power, not a Magiſteriall, but a Miniſteriall power, not the power of lords, but of ſtewards, not of princes, but of embaſſadours, or heraulds, not of lawgivers, but of cryers, or publiſhers of proclamations, not to command (as princes doe in the common wealth) but onely to ſignifye and declare the command and will of God. And therefore, that they may not define, or determine matters by the opinions or cuſtoms of men, but by the truth of God in the Scriptures, which they muſt ſhew for their warrant. Becauſe the Church it ſelfe, from whence their power is derived, hath no other power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it. <hi>And none can give that to others, which themſelves have not.</hi> And therefore to require and injoyne men to reſt in their determinations, and judgments, without ſufficient proofe of their agreement with the Scripture, is to give them <hi>an undue power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Diſt: This derived power and authority, which is given to Claſſes, in theſe things, is not a <hi>praerogative of juriſdiction,</hi> but of <hi>aeſtimation</hi> and reverence rather. Becauſe Gods ordinance hath limited the former to particular Churches, as his delegates in their owne matters, &amp; it is not in their power to alienate it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelves: But the latter is due to Claſſis conſiſting of grave, learned, prudent, and faythfull men, for their excelent perſonall gifts, in which reſpect, their judgment is to be much valued, and received with due regard. And for theſe cauſes the Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Doctors ſaught helpe of Damaſus, Ierom, Jnnocentius &amp;c. in the great queſtion, <hi>de lapſis,</hi> that the truth, being confirmed
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20023:130"/> by their teſtimony and conſent, who were orthodox and ſound in judgment, might have the more authority with men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, whoſe eyes are upon men that are famous for wiſdom &amp; ſoundnes in the fayth,<note place="margin">Confer. Chap. <hi>8.</hi> d. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> as Dr. Reynolds told Hart, yet, in the ſame place, he affirmeth that all Churches which the Apoſtles planted were aequall in power. And therefore to aſcribe unto them a power of juriſdiction over particular Churches, and that in things proper to themſelves, is to <hi>ſubject particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es under an undue power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Diſt: Whatſoever power or authority is given to Claſſes, in reference to particular Churches, it is given to them <hi>cumulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vè,</hi> not <hi>privativè.</hi> i. e. for the helpe &amp; ſtrengthening of them, in the excerciſe of that power which Chriſt hath given them not for the depriving them of it, or ſtreightening them in the due &amp; right uſe of it. For, whatſoever Eccleſiaſticall power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is given to any, it is, <hi>for aedification, not for deſtruction,</hi> in this ſenſe alſo.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 8.</note> And therefore all that power, whether aſſumed by them, or by others aſcribed to them, whereby particular Churches are abridged of their liberty and power, in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is an uſurped, and <hi>undue power.</hi> Theſe things being thus premiſed, our concluſion is, that.</p>
               <p>All that power which Claſſes have duely received by the free gift of particular Churches as a praerogative of aeſtimation and reverence, or any wayes for the helpe and ſtrengthening of thoſe Churches, in the well manadging of their owne matters, is a due power. But whatſoever power of juriſdiction they aſſume to themſelves for the depriving of particular Churches of that power, which Chriſt hath given them, it is an undue power. From this concluſion we will deduce two Conſectaryes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſect: That there is a lawfull expedient, and, in ſome caſes, a neceſſary uſe of the communion and combination of Churches, being rightly ordered for the helpe of particular Churches in theyre proper affayres. As, Firſt, In the choyſe of Miniſters. 1, for provocation, to quicken the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by their exhortations and admonitions to ſeeke out ſome fit man, if they be ſlack therein. 2, for direction, to counſayle and adviſe them, from the Scripture, about the fitnes of the men,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:20023:130"/> whom they would chooſe, and to admoniſh them of any notable unfitnes in them, to prevent the danger of infecting themſelves, or other Churches, by any dangerous errours maintained by them againſt the rule of fayth, or otherwiſe of common and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conſequence. 3, for countenance and protection againſt any that would deprive them of meete helpers, either by falſe ſuggeſtions to the Magiſtrates, or by rayſing contention and oppoſition among themſelves. Secondly. In the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of members, which is a matter of great moment, if the particular Churches ſeeke the helpe of neighbour Churches, to prevent any errour among themſelves, in a difficult caſe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſreport which may ariſe concerning theyr proceedings amongſt others, or to add the more ſtrength for the convincing of thoſe whom they are to cenſure, by the concurrence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of grave, and learned, and prudent men of neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they ſhall doe piouſly and prudently therein. Thirdly. In other caſes of difference, wherewith particular Churches are excerciſed, and whereby they are ſo divided that the matter can not be ended, and the differences compoſed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by reaſon of the aequall number of the oppoſites, on boath ſides, in matters that ſhould be determined by voyces, or the difficulty of the caſe in queſtion. In all theſe, and ſuch like caſes, much benefit and helpe may and ſhould be affoarded to particular Churches by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſociation with others, in manner aforeſaid, and they aught to ſeeke and uſe theyre helpe therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſect: That, if Claſſes, under pretence of theſe ends and benefits, aſſume unto themſelves ſuch a primacy of power, or ſuch an authority of juriſdiction over particular Churches, as 1, that they ſhall not chooſe their owne Miniſters, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their members, &amp;c. Without a power derived from them, or, 2, that, the Church is hindred from injoying Miniſters of ſound judgment, and unblameable behaviour, at their pleaſure. or, 3. that they may impoſe conformity to unwarrantable cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, or concluſions of their owne, as a condition without which Miniſters may not lawfully be received by ſuch a Church into the paſtorall office, or, 4, that their ſaying a man is not fit for ſuch a place, whom themſelves acknowledge to be fit for any
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20023:131"/> other place, and that without ſhewing the aequity of that their judgement from the Scriptures, or aequally and judiciouſly weighing the lawfull deſires of the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch, and their right in this particular, through a partial adhaering to one party, ſhould, or may deprive the Church of ſuch men. or, 5. that the Church may not injoy a man, againſt whom there is no juſt and ſufficient exception, as an aſſiſtant, for a time, or to preach amongſt them a ſermon or two, as a paſſant, without their leave: or, 6. that matters, proper to the Church and which may be ended in their owne Conſiſtory commodiouſly, yet being brought to them, though but by ſome one man, out of oppoſition to the reſt, that he may ſway matters according to his owne mind, by theyre helpe, may be taken from the Church and concluded by them, in favour of one, againſt the mind of the Church, and the Church muſt be bound to reſt in their determination, though they ſhew no warrant from the Scripture to ſatiſfye their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences about the aequity of their ſo determining and doing. In a word, whatſoever power they aſſume, or others give them, to deprive the Church of that power which Chriſt hath given it, in its owne matters, is againſt the end of their aſſociation and ſo an <hi>undue power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, for the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> or particular application of thoſe generalls to the preſent queſtion] The Anſwerer is chalenged by the Complainants for <hi>ſubjecting their Church under an undue power of the Claſſis, for his owne ends, and without warrant from the word.</hi> Out of queſtion, if it be an undue power, it is not onely without warrant from the word, but alſo contrary to the rule. But, it may be, they meane that he hath done this, without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any word which warranted his ſo doing. And, in that ſenſe, it is a complaint of too maſterly and ſelfewilled a carriage of himſelfe in Church affayres. Which they ſeeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to intend by that addition, when they ſay, that he doeth it, <hi>for his owne ends.</hi> Now, to detract from another for a mans owne commodity is <hi>againſt nature,</hi> as the heathen man could ſay, and he proved it thus,<note place="margin">Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In all which I will paſſe by the overflowing of his gall, which he too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſcovereth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his firſt anſwer he chargeth them with ſlandring the Claſſis, when they charge it with an <hi>undue power, which ſlander,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>is againſt the very ſtate of government, and forme of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline obſerved and practiſed in theſe reformed Churches,</hi> and calleth for proofe. Wherein, me thincketh, he had forgotten himſelfe: for, in the three next Sections, he himſelfe produceth the proofes which they brought: In examining his anſwers to thoſe proofes, I doubt, it will appeare, that the complaint is juſt, whereunto I referr the Reader, praying him, in the meane ſpace, to noate that the thing complained of, is, not all power excerciſed by the Claſſis, but onely an <hi>undue power,</hi> whereof whileſt they complaine, they doe implicitely acknowledge ſo much power to be due, as the word of God warranteth to them, and they ſuppoſe that the government and diſcipline of theſe Reformed Churches acknowledgeth no other power to be due to them. So that, if it ſhall be found that the Claſſis have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to themſelves an undue power over their Church, in any particular, the complaint againſt the Claſſis is juſt, and the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the <hi>very ſtate of the government of theſe Churches,</hi> is to be charged upon himſelfe, not upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his ſecond anſwer, he chargeth them with <hi>ſlander,</hi> for ſaying that <hi>he hath ſubjected the Church</hi> under an undue power. This alſo will appeare in the proofes of the juſtnes of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, in the following Sections, whereunto I referr the Reader.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his third anſwer he chargeth them with <hi>ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,</hi> for ſaying
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:20023:132"/> that he hath done this <hi>merely for his owne ends. This,</hi> he ſayth, is <hi>a great arrogancy, and ſetting of themſelves in Gods ſtead, whoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar it is to ſearch, and to judge the heart, and reynes.</hi> But, is this to anſwer complaints? or is it not to give new cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints? that, whereas formerly they complained that he depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Church of the power, which Chriſt had given it, now they may complaine, that he would put out the eyes of the members, and deprive them of the reaſon and underſtanding which God hath given them. For, if men may not judge of mens intentions, how is it that our Lord hath left it for a rule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſcerne <hi>falſe prophets</hi> whoſe intentions are wolviſh, and to raven, how ſheepiſh and harmeleſſe ſoever they ſeeme to be, in their pretences, when he ſayth, <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits?</hi>

It is true; it is Gods praerogative to judge the heart. But, what then? may not men, by the light of reaſon, which he hath given them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2.</note> judge the actions? God <hi>knoweth</hi> the <hi>thoughts a farr off,</hi> in their hidden cauſes, and ſeminall preparations, and that, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly, this is his peculiar glory, which is not arrogated by man, whileſt he profeſſeth onely to judge the cauſe by the effect, and the end by the meanes, which is, as if a man ſhould ſay. The ſmoake appeareth out of the chimney; therefore there is ſome fire in the houſe, or the man chuſeth ſuch a way; therefore his intent is to travayle to ſuch a place. The light of reaſon and ſenſe inableth a man thus to judge, and the light of Scripture warranteth it. How then can any man juſtly condemne it? As for the Anſwerers ends, in this action, reaſon in any of the complainants ſayth, they muſt be, either publick, or private. If his ends were the publick good of the Church, the meanes would be directed thereunto: but it ſeemes to them that the meanes are ſuch as tend rather to deprive the Church of men, whom they warrantably deſire, and to ſtreighten the Churches liberty and power in her owne matters, Hereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that his end is not their publick good, but ſome private
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20023:132"/> ſelfe reſpect. This judgment is but humane, and therefore fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. For it is poſſible that a man, by an errour in his judgment, may purſue a good end in wrong meanes: &amp; ſo the Anſwerer, thincking it to be more for the good of the Church to be ſtreightned thus and limited by the Claſſis, then to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, might have a good end, but miſtooke the meanes. And therefore, if they miſſed of the matter of the complaint, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging him for unlawfull ends, yet the complaint will be found juſt, if they accuſe him of uſing unwarra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table meanes. Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not free him, as I deſire, from theyre accuſation of ſelfe-aymes, in what he hath done, till he ſhall deny it, &amp; declare his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to have bene for the publick good, which when he ſhall have done, the Complaint will appeare to have bene a ſlander, and I ſhall rejoyce to ſee his integrity cleared, in this particular.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In his fourth anſwer, <hi>he would faine know,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>what that due power is, by which they would have the Church to be governed.</hi> The truth is. In all this paſſage appeareth much ſarcaſticall bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, unworthy of the learning, gravity, and holy function of the Anſwerer. Yet, I ſuppoſe, the Complainants would be ready, if they were called, to anſwer ſoberly that they deſire no other Church government, <hi>unto which they would willingly be ſubject,</hi> then that which Chriſt hath appoynted the Church to be under. What that is, if they know not, he aught to teach them: If they know it, and deſire it, he aught to <hi>lead them out,</hi> and <hi>to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them,</hi> as a faythfull <hi>ſhepheard,</hi> that <hi>the ſheep</hi> may <hi>follow him, as he followeth Chriſt,</hi> &amp; not to praejudice them againſt any good way, by a ſcoffing propoſall of mens differences in judgment, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome particular tract, or turning in the way, to the great ſcandall and offence of many, and the diſhonour of the Goſpel, and the hindrance of Reformation, by his joyning with the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes thereof, in an old cavill which hath turned many out of the way, and cauſed ſome to returne back to a mere neutrality in religion, till the profeſſours of it agree among themſelves about the path, wherein they will walke.</p>
               <p>Whereas he taketh occaſion againe, without provocation, to mention <hi>Mr. Iacob</hi> as an enimy to Claſſes and Synods, that I might ſpeake a word in the cauſe of the dumbe, and of the

                  <q>The Elderſhip of the firſt ſort, he ſayth, is a compound office wherein all the Elders doe, in the name of the wholl Church, adminiſter all the buiſeneſſes of the Church, that is, of the Lord, by common authority and counſaile. And, for this purpoſe, he alleadgeth many texts out of the old and new teſtaments. Theſe buiſeneſſes, he ſayth, are either judiciary or extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary. Iudiciary buiſeneſſes are ſuch things as are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the judgment of the Church, which are, either mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doubtfull, which muſt be defined by the Scriptures, or
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:20023:134"/> cenſures to be adminiſtred. Extrajudiciary buiſeneſſes, are Elections, ordinations, cheife care of diſpoſing the holy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, keeping of order in the aſſembly, and all things which are to be done. Yet, in matters of greateſt moment, and which concerne the good, or ruine of the wholl Church, he ſayth, the Elders, after conſultation had among themſelves, muſt tell their opinions to the Church, that, if they have any thing to counſail, or to object, it may be brought in, and afterwards, the opinions and aſſent of all being declared, matters are to be concluded, unleſſe it be neceſſary to referr the buiſenes to a greater aſſembly of Elders, for the avoyding, or compoſing of differences, which is then to be done when the difference is betweene the greater part of the Church. And theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of the greateſt moment, are, the cenſures, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and abſolution from it, which is to be done in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, by the AUTHORITY OF THE WHOLE CHURCH, orders alſo of the greateſt moment to be made, controverſyes of fayth to be compoſed, the elections and juſt depoſing of Miniſters, &amp; other things aequall to theſe, or greater then they all,</q> which muſt be thus tranſacted, as he plentifully declareth from Scripture. Thus I have faythfully tranſlated the words of this eminent light, in his time Mr. Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Fenner, who was joyned with Mr. Cartwright in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick miniſtry to the Engliſh Company in Antwerpe, to whom, and to that worke of his Mr. Cartwright, in an epiſtle to him praefixed to that booke, giveth a ſingular teſtimony, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to Moſes, who, from Mount Nebo, viewed the wholl land of Canaan, as it were, with one caſt of his eye, to whom the Anſwerer him ſelfe referred me (wherein I admire his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence) as to one that made for him. The Reader may ſee how he leaveth the wholl power of juriſdiction in the particular Church, and bindeth them no further to make uſe of other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Senats, out of themſelves, then neceſſity requireth, and he doeth not acknowledge that it is a caſe of that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; but when the avoyding of troubles and diſſentions in the Church makes it neceſſary. And when is that? Not when one alone contentiouſly differeth from all the reſt. But, when the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:20023:135"/> difference is among the greater part. And that, in ſuch a caſe, the judgment of the wholl Church is firſt to be tryed and the opinions, and aſſent of all being declared, matters are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.<note place="margin">Idem ibid p. <hi>280.</hi>

That Chriſt gave the keyes to the wholl Church, but ſo, that there ſhould be certaine men that ſhould uſe the keyes to the good of the Church and glory of God.</hi> For the proofe of the former, that the right of power is in every particular Church, he uſeth five Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the 6: &amp; 7. chapters, &amp; then, in the 8. chapter, he cometh to ſpeak of the excerciſe and ordinary execution of this power, which is, he ſayth, in the Church-officers or rulers, yet, with this moderation, that this diſpenſation of the Churches power in the officers be according to a well tempered forme, partly Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:20023:135"/> partly Democraticall, the Church committing thoſe things to the preſbytery, which it can not commodiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme by it ſelfe, and retaining that excerciſe of power which belongs to the dignity, authority, and liberty which it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt. Thus he wholy deſtroyeth that demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craty, or popular Anarchy, which Beza juſtly condemneth in Morellius, and is, by ſome, unjuſtly imputed to thoſe that plead for a due reformation of Churches, according to the rules of the word, and the primitive patternes. Of the firſt ſort of things, which the Church committeth to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, becauſe it cannot commodiouſly performe them by it ſelfe, he ſpeaketh in cap. 9.10.11. of the ſecond ſort of things, which the Church retaineth in it ſelfe, becauſe it can commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly excerciſe them by it ſelfe, he ſpeaketh in cap. 12. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by 22. Arguments, he proveth the Churches ſuperiority over her Paſtors and rulers, in 3 reſpects. 1. of the end, the power which they have being given them for her aedification. 2, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the application of it to the perſons, 3 in reſpect of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the uſe of it, if it be abuſed. And in cap. 18. 13, making a compariſon betweene a particular Church, and Churches combined in Synods and Claſſes, he affirmeth that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce betweene them is, not in the intenſive conſideration of their power (which the congregation hath, in reference to the Keyes, within it ſelfe) but in the extenſive power onely, wherein the Synod hath a power extended to more objects, viz, to many Churches (in things common) whereas the power of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church is confined, and limited within its owne compaſſe. The ſame authour, in the 20 chapter, ſpeaking of the ſummity, or ſupremacy of the power of particular Congregations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the due limits of it, wherein, he conceiveth, it is to be underſtood, and bounded, as, that the power of particular Churches is cheife. 1. in its owne matters, not in things commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to many Churches. 2. in caſe it be able to tranſact its owne mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters within it ſelfe: as, if a doubt or controverſy ariſe, the Church hath power to terminate it, if it can: as the Church of Antioch firſt diſputed the matter among themſelves, &amp; laboured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the difference within themſelves, but finding (not a want

               <p>To keepe out Miniſters, whom the Church deſireth, being free from haereſy or ſchyſme, is not in the power of the Claſſis, by any warrant from the word, or by any order eſtabliſhed in the Synods of theſe countryes.

               <p>The 2 firſt, in reference to the firſt aggravation, ſerve to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Complainants of a double ſlander. 1. of ſlandering the Anſwerer, in ſaying, that he gave the Claſſis this power. 2. of ſlandering the Claſſis, in ſaying, they received and excerciſed this undue power, boath which he aggravateth bitterly enough, after his manner. To be breife in ſo plaine a caſe. Had they power to hinder the ſetling of any Miniſter in any Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had examined his cauſe, or heard what he could ſay, in his owne defence, as they did in Mr. H. caſe? or to deprive the Church of a man, whom they deſired, only becauſe he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to baptiſe all that are preſented, by whomſoever, though they were, neither members of that Church, nor otherwiſe knowne, and that in Amſterdam, as they did in my caſe? Or to proceed againſt men ſo farr that abhorr all haereſy and ſchyſme? From the Scriptures they have no ſuch power, nor from the Churches, nor from the Synods, nor from the fundamentall lawes of their owne conſtitution. Whence then? The anſwerer oppoſeth men, upon needleſſe jealouſyes, and then craveth the helpe of the Claſſis, to keepe them out: they, conceiving it to be their part to defend the miniſters, interpoſe ſtrenuouſly (ab, that I could ſay, juſtly, and orderly!) and judge that ſuch men are not fit to be ſetled in that Church. Hereupon the members complaine that he giveth, and they receive an <hi>undue power,</hi> in this particular. Where is now the double ſlander? will he deny the fact? It is too evident. Will he deny it to be unduely done? The very forme of ſubſcription, required by the Claſſis it ſelfe, will witnes againſt him, which excludeth not any man from the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:20023:137"/> Miniſtry in theſe Churches for that cauſe. And can they duely and juſtly require that of the preacher of the Engliſh Church, which is not required of any Dutch Miniſter, by the orders of the Claſſis it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>But the Anſwerer gave them not this power. <hi>The power which the Miniſters of the Claſſis have is not of my gift,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>they had that power, which they excerciſe, before I wae.</hi> The queſtion is not of <hi>the power which they have,</hi> in generall, but of a power which they excerciſe, in ſome particular, viz, in that, whereof they complaine. And herein, they doe not complaine of his <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their due</hi> power, but of his giving them an <hi>undue power,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of men, whom they deſired, without ſufficient cauſe. This power they tooke not to themſelves, till they were called upon to interpoſe for the prevention of ſome imagined danger, in the Engliſh Church. Who ſuggeſted thoſe jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes? Did not the Anſwerer? Who importuned them to wright what they did, in the caſes here mentioned? Did not the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werer? Who bound the Church to reſt in the wrightings of thoſe Miniſters, in theſe caſes? Who, but the Anſwerer? Let the Scripture be ſearched, and the text ſhewen, wherein the word hath given them this power, to hinder the Church from chuſing a Miniſter, otherwiſe free from all exception, onely for ſuch cauſes? Let the Synods be examined. Js there one Canon in them all to warrant their excerciſing ſuch a power? Will the Engliſh Church acknowledge that they have given the Claſſis this power? If the Scriptures, the Synods, the Church gave it not them, if themſelves ſaught it not, tooke it not, till it was given them, it muſt needs be that the Anſwerer gave it them. By what right, either he gave it, or they received it, I inquire not, let them agree about that betweene themſelves, or rather let them, in ſimplicity and truth, ſatiſfye, firſt their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; then the Complainants.</p>
               <p>In his third anſwer he chargeth Mr. Hook: and me with ſchyſme. It was requiſite he ſhould doe ſo, elſe, he knew, that the Claſſis and he muſt beare the blame of uſurping and excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing an undue power, to the wronging of the Church. Let us ſee how he proveth it.</p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:20023:138"/>
               <p>Firſt. In Mr. Hooker whom he chargeth with fowre opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which tended to ſchyſme, as he ſayth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The two firſt concerne the Browniſts. as, 1. his opinion that they might lawfully be received for members of that Church. 2. that, in ſome caſes, the members of this Church might heare at their aſſemblyes.</p>
               <p>To helpe the Reader to a right underſtanding of this cauſe (till Mr. H. ſhall thinck it fit to ſpeake for himſelfe) I will ſhew 3. things. 1. That Mr. H. did not approve of the Browniſts judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the point of Seperation: for, in expreſſe words, he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth to the firſt queſtion. <hi>To ſeperate from the faithfull aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and Churches in England, as no Churches, is an errour in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſinne in practiſe, held, and maintayned by the Browniſts. And therefore to communicate with them, either in this their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or practiſe is ſinfull, and utterly unlawfull.</hi> 2. That he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his judgement herein with conſiderable cautions. as 1. that men ſhould <hi>renounce their opinion and practiſe.</hi> 2. that care be taken to prevent <hi>offence, either by incouraging them in their way; or by drawing ours to a further approbation of that way then is meet.</hi> 3. that whatſoever moderation he allowed, in this caſe,, was to be underſtood. 1. according to the former caution and interpretation, and 2. upon ſuppoſition, 1. that <hi>they erred</hi> in this point, <hi>not obſtinately, but for want of light and conviction,</hi> as appeareth in his anſwer to the ſecond queſtion. 2. that the perſon thus opinionated, is, <hi>in his judgment and life otherwiſe altogether unblameable, &amp; ſuch an one, as, in the judgment of reaſonable charity, may be counted a member of Chriſt, &amp; ſo a Saint.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. 3. That <hi>the judging a man unfit to be received a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, for an erronious opinion in ſuch a kind, is to confirme the Browniſts in that unſupportable and abſurd cenſure which now they maintayne, touching thoſe that hold the Churches in England true Churches, &amp; profeſſe they will occaſionally communicate therein:</hi> as appeareth in his anſwer to the third queſtion.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being duely weighed, I leave it to the judgment of the indifferent Reader whether a man allowing ſuch men to be received members with that Church, or others differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them in judgement and practiſe, about Seperation, to heare with
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:20023:138"/> them occaſionally, and <hi>extra caſum ſcandali,</hi> without offence, and expreſſing himſelfe in theſe points, with ſuch interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cautions, and ſuppoſitions, may juſtly be charged with ſchyſme?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third opinion which he held, and, the Anſwerer ſayth, tended to ſchyſme, was <hi>that private men might preach and expound the Scripture</hi> &amp;c. In the 17. queſtion propounded to him by the Anſwerer, he expreſſeth his judgment by a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a double ground, from which this may be done, viz, either <hi>ex officio,</hi> or <hi>ex dono.</hi> i. e. by vertue of an office, (and this no man may doe, without a calling thereunto from the Church,) or from the gift that Chriſt doeth diſpenſe to ſeverall members, according to their meaſure, &amp; the place they hold in the body, and that thus any Chriſtian may privately doe, as opportunity &amp; expediency ſerve, he holdeth, and therein profeſſeth his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Dr. Ames in the 14. Booke of caſes of conſc: cap. 25. who proveth it, both by Scripture and reaſon. And will any man ſay that this is an opinion or practiſe of Schyſme?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth opinion, which he held, and for which the Anſwerer accuſeth him of ſchyſme, is, that <hi>Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the Claſſis might chooſe a Miniſter, either without, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the conſent of the Claſſis, under which they ſtood.</hi> Let his anſ. wer to the 11. Queſt: be examined, which we will tranſcribe word for word out of the written copy.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <q>11. Whether a particular Congregation have power to call a Miniſter without the approbation of the Claſſis, under which they ſtand?</q> Neg:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Before I anſwer the Quaere, I would aſke one thing, which might give a litle light to that which ſhall be ſaid afterwards, namely, how the firſt Claſſis that ever was upon the face of the earth came to be conſtituted? And, J conceive, it cannot be denyed, but that it was made up by the combination of ſeverall miniſters, and Elders, and of ſeverall Congregations. Whence it muſt needs follow, that thoſe particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had power from Chriſt for to call, &amp; ſo did, by that their power, chooſe &amp; call their Miniſters fully &amp; compleatly before
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:20023:139"/> there was a Claſſis, and therefore had their power not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from a Claſſis, or by it, but from the direct ordinance and appoyntment of Chriſt, which power they may not give away, and none can take it away, being a legacy left them by the Lord Ieſus, as Dr. Ames diſputes and determines in his 4. booke of his caſes of conſcience.</q> pag. 165.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Touching the Quaere then my opinion is this: A particular Congregation hath compleat power, by Chriſt his inſtitution, to give a compleat call to a miniſter, without any derived power from a Claſſis. They which had compleat and perfect Miniſters, before any Claſſis, had power fully to call them, without any Claſſis. But a particular Congregation, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat Miniſters, i. e. perfectly and compleatly called, before any Claſſis. Ergo. Yet, if by mutuall conſent, the Congregation hath freely combined it ſelfe with the Claſſis, they ſhall doe piouſly and expediently freely to crave the approbation of the Claſſis, that they may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, or, if doubts ariſe, better directed in their courſe. All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes provided, that, if the Claſſis ſhould not approve, they may lawfully, and without ſinne, chuſe without, or againſt the approbation of the Claſſis, if they ſaw good reaſon, by the convenient fitnes of the party to induce them therunto. And ſo I judge of the 11 Queſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto all which I will add, that thoſe things were but ſecret, in his owne mind, till the Anſwerer, to get matter againſt him, drew them out by theſe queſtions which he wrote to him, and required his anſwer to them, and they ſhould have ſo remayned for ever (ſuch is the peaceablenes of his diſpoſition) if the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werer had deſired him to conceale his judgment therein, for prevention of offence.</p>
               <p>Secondly. As for me; he layeth the ſame accuſation upon me alſo, and bringeth three pretences for it.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:20023:139"/> things. 1. <hi>The ſubjection of the people to their lawfull Paſtors.</hi> 2. <hi>The connexion and communion which many particular Churches &amp; Paſtors of them have among themſelves.</hi> 3. <hi>In holding the ſame rule of fayth.</hi> Which of theſe wayes did this action make me guilty of Schyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me? 1. Not in the firſt. For, did I attempt to draw the people, from their Paſtorall relation, to a popular Anarchy, as Corah would have done, in his conſpiracy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3.</note> under a pretence that <hi>all the Lords people are holy?</hi> or, did they, by my perſuaſion, flee from their owne Church or Conſiſtory with complaints to other Churches, in ſuch caſes as might have bene ended among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as thoſe Schyſmaticks did in Cyprian? No.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.</note> I was ſo farr from drawing the people from their Paſtor, that, by that very meane, I held them together, my ſelfe giving them example of conſtantly hearing him, and deferring my private excerciſe, till above an howre after the publick was finiſhed. And I am hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry that my adviſe to their Paſtor, and intreaty, that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might be quietly ended within themſelves, prevayled not with him to prevent the publiſhing of their diſtractions, in this manner, to the world. 2. Not in the ſecond. For, neither they, nor I refuſed to communicate with any reformed Churches, in the performance of the Acts of Religion, either out of ſelfe-conceit; as did Novatus, Donatus, Lucifer &amp;c. or for any other unwarrantable reſpects. 3. Nor in the third: For the Anſwerer himſelfe confeſſeth (though unwillingly) that, in that excerciſe, I preached againſt ſchyſming, nor doth he, in the middſt of all his bitternes, nor ſhall he ever be able to accuſe me juſtly of forſaking the rule of fayth in any point.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>My approving the Act of the Elders in admitting me to preach, as an aſſiſtant, without the conſent of the Claſſis]</hi> whither did the Anſwerers paſſion tranſport him, when he wrote this for an evidence to prove me guilty of Schyſme? For. 1. who ever heard that it is an act of Schyſme for a man to preach at the deſire of any Church, onely as an aſſiſtant, without the conſent of the Claſſis? By that rule, himſelfe and the wholl Church was guilty of Schyſme for letting Mr. D. preach, a yeare or two together, without conſent of the Claſſis. For he did it as an aſſiſtant. But 2. He doeth not charge me with doing it neither, but onely with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:20023:140"/> that act. If I be a Schyſmatick for approving it, what are the Elders that made it? And, why doeth he ſuffer them to come to the Lords table, and to goe on ſo long unconvinced, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed from their Schyſme? Is Schyſme ſuch a ſmall ſinne that he regards it not? or is this proofe of their Schyſme ſo ſlight that he thincks they will not regard it? He bol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly calleth it Schyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but bringeth no proofe that it is ſo from Scriptures nor Reaſon. Why ſo? Is it becauſe it is ſufficient that he ſayth it? or becauſe he cannot prove it? If the firſt; he is deceived: if the ſecond; he deceiveth. 4. If the Church have power to chuſe a meet Paſtor or aſſiſtant, the Miniſters of the Claſſis have no power to deprive them of him, or to hinder him from accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their call, or from ſatiſfying their lawfull deſire. For, their power is not <hi>privative,</hi> but <hi>cumulative,</hi> in that ſenſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in ſuch a caſe, it is a Schyſme from the Church in him that hindereth the Church herein, not in him that aſſiſteth them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>My maintayning of the power of particular Churches to be cheife in theyre owne matters, &amp; applying this to the admiſſion of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to preach as aſſiſtant &amp;c. though theſe Churches be united in Synods and Claſſes.</hi> And is this a ſufficient evidence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to ground ſo deepe an accuſation, as that of Schyſme is? If ſo; let him ſhew it by Scriptures, or good reaſon, but with all, to guide his judgment, let him know that the mere preaching, as aſsiſtant in a Church, at the intreaty of the Church, is not numbred among thoſe common cauſes, which, by the order of theſe reformed Churches, are appropriated to the cognition or conſent of the Claſſes: it is, in it ſelfe, to be accounted among the things which are proper to particular Churches. And, is it a Schyſmaticall tenet to hold that things proper to particular Churches, are under the power of particular Churches, which are cheife in matters that are properly their owne? what then will he ſay to that Canon of the Synod at Midleborough. <hi>Thoſe things ſhall not be handled in the greater aſſemblyes, which may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the leſſer.</hi> Can. 25. &amp; to the Canons of the Synod of 3 Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>Were theſe Synods ſchyſmaticall Conventicles? or, were their Canons ſchyſmaticall concluſions? How then is this, which I affirme, ſchyſmaticall?</p>
               <p>To brand me with an imputation of ſchyſme, he ſpareth not theſe Synods which deliver the ſame thing, in effect, that I ſay, and all thoſe worthyes who have written concerning Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall diſcipline, or the authority of Councills, of whom we ſpake in the former Section, or, which have handled the power of particular Churches in chuſing their owne Paſtors, of whom we ſpake in the foregoing Section: Yea, I wiſh, he may not be found to beare falſe witnes againſt the truth it ſelfe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which we have declared, in both thoſe Sections, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſo much as I have ſaid in this matter.</p>

His fourth anſwer ſuppoſeth that <hi>eminent men may cauſe eminent danger by their private opinions.]</hi> The men, in whom he inſtanceth, I confeſſe, were not inferiour to either of us, in learning. But that which he intimateth, concerning opinions held by them which tended to the ruine and deſolation of Churches, if he apply it to this queſtion, about the power of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches to admit of Miniſters to preach as aſsiſtants, I cannot acknowledge to be true, upon the former grounds, but, if he meane any other opinions or practiſes, it is nothing to the matter in queſtion.</p>

               <p>Now let us ſee what anſwers he pretendeth to make. 1. to their complaint againſt the proceeding of the Claſsis, in this particular. 2. to their complaint of his giving this undue power to the Claſsis.</p>
               <p>Firſt. To their complaint of the undue proceeding of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.] Herein he anſwereth nothing to the purpoſe. For he, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denyeth the fact, nor giveth any ſatiſfaction about the aequi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of it. In a word, he ſo anſwereth, as if he ſaught nothing elſe but how to evade anſwering, and to get ſome hole to hide his head in. Wherefore, that the truth in this matter may appeare, we will conſider two things. 1. <hi>de facto,</hi> whether they have made ſuch lawes and orders, or not? 2. <hi>de jure,</hi> whether they have done it by a due, or by <hi>an undue</hi> power?</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they have made ſuch lawes and orders can not be denyed. For, <hi>if the praeſcription of neceſſary obſervances,</hi> be a law; <hi>if the impoſition of any thing with a binding power,</hi> be a law; if <hi>the decrees, to the obedience whereof men are any way compelled,</hi> are lawes; the things inſtanced in, to witt, conformity to their ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cuſtoms, and promiſcuous adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, according to the wrighting of the five Miniſters, were impoſed as lawes upon me. For, did they not bind me to reſt in that wrighting, and to conforme to thoſe cuſtoms, under no leſſe paenalty then my not admittance to the paſtorall worke, in the Engliſh Church, notwithſtanding the unanimous deſire of the Congregation? Was not this to make them neceſſary obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances? The caſe is ſo cleare that the Anſwerer himſelfe doeth not at all deny it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us ſee, whether the power, whereby they have done this, be a due, or an undue power. And it will appeare to be
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:20023:142"/> undue, if, neither the Scripture, nor the Nationall Synods, nor the Church, nor any good reaſon have given them any ſuch power. And this we will declare, with Gods aſsiſtance, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, in every one of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt. The Scripture is ſo farr from giving the Claſſis any power of making lawes to bind particular Churches, in caſes of that nature, that it doeth not once mention any ſuch kind of combination, nor doeth allow any ſuch power to the deputyes of any Churches conſulting together for their common good. The Texts, which Bellarmine alleadgeth for the power of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills in making lawes, are the ſame which the Anſwerer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times harpeth upon, in this caſe, but Iunius clearly ſheweth, that they make nothing to the purpoſe.</p>

The caſes are not alike. For, in thoſe times, the mind of God was revealed to thoſe Judges, in obſcure and difficult caſes, by ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and anſwers from God himſelfe. 2. He grants that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of thoſe Iudges was to be obeyed, <hi>ſervatâ clauſulâ ſalutari;</hi> that holeſom clauſe, which Moſes puts in, being obſerved, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſentence of the law,</hi>

                  <hi>which they ſhall teach thee.</hi> So that the ſentence of thoſe Iudges did no further bind men to reſt in it, then it was according to the ſentence of the Law. And yet theſe were Iudges by Gods expreſſe appoyntment, which the Claſſes have not to ſhew for their judicatory, in the ſame manner as thoſe Judges had.</p>

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</note>2. The other Text is Acts 15. alleadged by Bellarmine to prove the binding force of the decrees of Councills, and, by the Anſwerer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 31. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 5.</note> to ſhew the authority of the Claſſis: whereunto Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us giveth 2 anſwers alſo. 1. <hi>Non ſequitur ex particulari, ſi cuſtodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda fuerint decreta Concilij Apoſtolici, ergo &amp; omnium ſervari oportere.</hi> It doeth not follow, from a particular, that, becauſe the decrees of an Apoſtolicall Councill are to be obſerved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the decrees of all Councills muſt be ſo kept.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cont.</hi> 3. <hi>lib</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.</note> And, whereas
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:20023:142"/> Bellarmine affirmeth that the queſtion there was not defined by Scripture, but by the voyces of the Apoſtles, Iunius denyeth that any thing was ordayned in that Councill, but from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he had before demonſtrated, &amp; thereunto referreth the Reader. And, whereas Bellarmine ſayth that the decree of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles was not left to the examination of the Diſciples, but, that they were ſimply commanded to obey, Iunius chargeth him with falſely ſuppoſing two things. 1. <hi>That the Apoſtles alone made this order.</hi> For the Elders concurred with the Apoſtles in this ſentence, and the wholl Church, all of them being taught by the ſpirit of truth, to thinck the ſame thing. <hi>And this,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>is the manner of proceeding in thoſe Councills, where Chriſt is praeſident.</hi> 2. That the ſame reſpect is to be had to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of others, as of the Apoſtles. Which is an errour, he ſayth, For it was the ſingular priviledge of the Apoſtles, that they had immediate aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, and infallibility, in their Apoſtolicall determinations, ſo that, what they delivered was to be received without examination, whereas the dictates &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of all other are to be examined by their wrightings, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth that the Scripture acknowledgeth no ſuch power of making lawes to be due to the Claſſes, unleſſe they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome other texts, which, when they ſhall be alleadged, ſhall be further examined, if God permit.</p>
               <p>Secondly. No generall Councills, or Nationall Synods have acknowledged any ſuch power to be due to Claſſes, for aught I can find, if any others have found out any ſuch, let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Canon of ſuch Councills and Synods, wherein it was ſo concluded, and, the ground of ſuch a determination being found ſufficient, I ſhall willingly receive it, and ſubmit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. In the meane ſpace, let it be conſidered, that they, who diſtinguiſh betweene Generall, Nationall, Provinciall, and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Councills, ſay, that the two former have authority to make Canons, but the two latter onely to ſee that the Canons impoſed by the two former, be obſerved,<note place="margin">Praef<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad diſtinct. <hi>18</hi>
                  </note> as may be ſeene in Gratian.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. The Church hath not given them any ſuch power,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:20023:143"/> nor indeed, can it. 1. It hath not; as appeareth in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of it as undue, &amp; as a greivance, and in the profeſſion of diverſe of the members that they never knew that the Church was ſo ſubjected. 2, That it cannot; appeareth in this, that the Church it ſelfe hath no ſuch power, and none can give what they have not. In what ſenſe this aſſertion is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and upon what grounds it is to be received, we ſhall have occaſion to declare in examining his anſwer, ſhortly to follow, whereunto I referr the Reader.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. That no good reaſon giveth the Claſſis this power of making lawes, to bind particular Churches, will appeare, if two things be declared. 1. what things are required to the making of a law. 2. what inſtances they produce to ſhew the undue proceedings of that Claſſis herein. Firſt, the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a law are theſe, at leaſt. 1. a due authority, or power orderly authoriſed thereunto. 2. its conſonancy and conſent with the law of God. 3. that it is referred unto, and doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the common good. Secondly, let the inſtances produced by them be brought to theſe rules, and it will be found, 1. that they want ſufficient authority for making of ſuch lawes, 2. that ſuch a law agreeth not with the law of God. 3. that it is not referred to the publick and common good, by what hath bene already ſaid, partly in this Section, partly in the 12 Section, and partly in other Sections. The iſſue, whereunto the inſtances drive, is, that the Claſſis excerciſeth an undue power, when it bindeth men to any obſervance, upon no better ground then the mere cuſtom of a place, which is then done, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is not warranted by the word. For, howſoever, in civill adminiſtrations, in Common wealths, ſome cuſtoms have the force of a law,<note place="margin">Hist. <hi>1.</hi> part <hi>2.</hi> book. <hi>4.</hi> Chap. <hi>15.</hi> Sect: Vlp. li. <hi>29</hi>
                  </note> (as Sir Walter Raleigh well obſerveth.) Yet, in Church matters it will not hold, the reaſon of Churches and Commonwealths being not the ſame. But, if the rule hold in Commonwealths, that, <hi>quod ab initio vitioſum eſt, non poteſt tractu temporis convaleſcere,</hi> much more will it hold in the Church, in ſuch a caſe as that unwarrantable cuſtom of promiſcuous bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.</note> which I have proved to be unlawfull, in Sect. 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly. Seing nothing hath bene ſaid by the Anſwerer,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:20023:143"/> in defence of the proceeding of the Claſſis, in anſwer to their complaint of their excerciſing an undue power, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, let us now ſee if he anſwer ſufficiently in his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, wherein, we will, with Gods helpe, examine, what he ſayth in anſwer 1. to the generall charge. 2. to the proofes of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt. The generall charge is, that <hi>he hath given them this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due power.</hi> Hereunto he pretendeth to make five Anſwers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſayth <hi>it is untrue.</hi> He onely ſayth ſo, but doeth not ſhew it to be untrue, by declaring that, either the Scriptures, or the Nationall Synods, or the Church, or good reaſon hath given it them. And ſo ſeemeth to be content that the ſuſpicion of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping may lye upon the wholl Claſſis, rather then he ſhould be ſuſpected to have given it them. But he will not ſo evade, if what was replyed to the ſame anſwer, in the foregoing Section, be conſidered, and applyed to this alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his ſecond anſwer he ſeemeth ſo to deny his giving them this undue power, as withall ſecretly to confeſſe that he <hi>gave them counſaile to uſe this power.</hi> which he hath not proved to be due. That it is undue hath bene proved already,, and that, it being ſo, he hath <hi>not behaved himſelfe as a paſtor in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church,</hi> in counſailing them to uſe an undue power over his Church, needs no proofe at all, the thing done being ſufficient evidence againſt him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third anſwer is a mere retortion of the complaint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Complainants, and a recrimination of them for <hi>allowing the Conſiſtory to make orders &amp; lawes,</hi> &amp; thereupon he demandeth, <hi>can this power of making lawes and orders, be lawfull, and due in a Conſiſtory, and yet an undue power in the Claſſis? Are they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of themſelves?</hi> For anſwer hereunto, it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. 1, That orders and lawes are ill confounded by the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werer, They may make orders who have no power of making lawes: So Iunius diſtinguiſheth them fitly. <hi>Praelatorum non eſt</hi>

                  </gap>. <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Governours may give orders, not lawes, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, not praecepts.</hi> Elſe where he ſayth, the Fathers called them more fitly <hi>Canons,</hi> becauſe a Canon ſerveth to direct <hi>agentem
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:20023:144"/> volùntariè,</hi> one that acteth voluntarily, whereas a law, <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate etiam cogit in voluntarium,</hi> compelleth a man againſt his will, Chame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> alſo expreſſeth himſelfe acutely to the ſame purpoſe,<note place="margin">De eccleſiâ p. <hi>367. 368.</hi>
                  </note> ſaying, that the determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Churches are more fitly called admonitions and exhortations then lawes, and that, when they agree with the word, they are <hi>admonitions,</hi> in reſpect of the Church, but <hi>lawes</hi> in reſpect of God onely, to wit, becauſe the Church commendeth that which God hath commanded, and that which the Church ſo commendeth is the word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all miſtake may be prevented, &amp; the two extremes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded, of tyranny; by aſcribing too much power to the Church, and of diſſolute libertiniſme, and Anabaptiſme; by denying its due power, in this particular, we will declare what authority the Church hath about lawes and orders, by diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene lawes already made,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>Mat:</hi> 18.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21.</note> and lawes to be made. In the firſt, we grant, that Church governours have great authority and power, to wit, of providing that men yeeld due obedience to all Gods lawes and ordinances, which they are to commend and declare to the Church, and to exact their obedience thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And indeed this is the very end of all Eccleſiaſticall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Rom. 1.5. and 15.18. So that herein they have more power then of admoniſhing, and exhorting, and reproving onely, they have the power of cenſuring, and thereby of compelling the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall members to their duety, and of ſeeing that all things be done in the houſe of God <hi>decently and in order.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſenſe, I conceive, <hi>the order to be made in the Conſiſtory,</hi> is to be underſtood, the things thereby ordered being no other then that rule of having all holy adminiſtrations performed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and in order requireth. And, being ſo underſtood, it doeth not at all patronize that undue power of the Claſſis. 1. Becauſe the Church hath that power, in her owne matters, which the Claſſis hath not. 2. Becauſe this was but <hi>an order,</hi> for my accommodation, in my voluntary obedience of the word warranted by the rule, but the contrary, made by them, is a law, for the eſtabliſhing of an evill cuſtom, not warranted by the word, and to compell me, againſt my will, to the obſervance of it.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:20023:144"/>
               <p>As for the ſecond. The things, about which lawes are made, are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary, or indifferent. <hi>Things neceſſary</hi> are things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded or forbidden in the Scripture. And they are neceſſary, either abſolutely or in ſome conſiderable reſpect. <hi>Things abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to godlines are ſo conſtituted in the Scripture that no place is left for the impoſitions of any new law givers. About <hi>things neceſſary, in ſome conſiderable reſpect,</hi> Churchgovernours have power to give order, as did the Synod at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem touching thoſe things which they called <hi>neceſſary</hi> Act. 15.28. viz, neceſſary during the time of the offence of the Iew which was <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to be avoyded. Hereunto alſo ſerveth that rule, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order</hi> Cor. 14.40. but the rule of that decency muſt be, not the will and pleaſure of men, but the light of nature, Scripture, or warrantable cuſtom. For ſo it was in the inſtances given in that chapter, as, for men to pray with long hayre, &amp; woemen bare-headed, in thoſe Eaſterne countryes, and for woemen to ſpeake in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and for many men to ſpeake at once. <hi>Things indifferent</hi> are ſuch as, being neyther commanded nor forbidden in the Scripture, may be variouſly permitted or prohibited according to various circumſtances And they are, eyther improperly, or properly ſo called. <hi>Things improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called indifferent,</hi> are things not neceſſary, but onely <hi>expedient</hi> in ſome reſpect. In ſuch caſes Churchgovernours have power to declare the decency and expediency of them: yea, and to adviſe and perſwade the practiſe thereof, but not by ſtanding lawes to bind the people thereunto. As the Apoſtle <hi>gave his judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> 1. Cor. 7.25.40. &amp; adviſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſingle life, in time of the Churches diſtreſſe: yea, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, for avoyding <hi>trouble in the fleſh,</hi> verſ. 26.28. but would not bind them to it, neither in point of conſcience, nor of outward practiſe as having <hi>no commandment from the Lord</hi> (verſ. 25.) and ſayth that ſuch a commandment had bene <hi>a ſnare</hi> (verſ. 35. And herein the power of Churchgovernours falleth ſhort of the authority of civill Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, who may, in civill matters, make ſtanding and binding lawes for any thing expedient to the Common wealth. Whereunto ſubjects are bound readily to ſubmit. (1. Pet. 2.13.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Things properly called indifferent</hi> I doe not find in Scripture that ever Churchgovernours did adviſe &amp; perſwade them, much leſſe charge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand them, leaſt of all make ſtanding, &amp; binding lawes to determine them: nor doth that place in (1. Cor. 14.40.) give them any ſuch power, nor have the Apoſtles themſelves received any ſuch authority from
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:20023:145"/> Chriſt, as appeareth in the commiſſion given them, which was onely to <hi>teach men to obſerve and doe what Chriſt ſhall command them,</hi> Mat. 28.20. Their office being onely miniſteriall &amp; oeconomicall, Chriſt reſerving to himſelfe the ſoveraigne lawgiving power, as his praerogative.</p>
               <p>For application of the premiſes to the caſe in queſtion, I demand whether this cuſtom be thus impoſed as a thing properly indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or as expedient, or as neceſſary in ſome conſiderable reſpect, or as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary? If it be <hi>properly indifferent;</hi> why doe they, by command, make the practiſe of it neceſſary? If it be <hi>expedient;</hi> let them ſhew the expediency of it, &amp; leave men free. If it be <hi>neceſſary, in thoſe conſiderable</hi> reſpects; let it appeare that the contrary practiſe will be ſo offenſive or diſorderly that, for the avoyding of that offence or diſorder, a miniſter is bound to doe it. If it be <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to godlines; let the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be ſhewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth that practiſe, or forbiddeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary.</p>
               <p>His fourth anſwer is not worth a Reply.</p>
               <p>His fifth anſwer maketh againſt himſelfe. For, if they leave men at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>about things indifferent &amp;c.</hi> (wherein they are to be approved as walking according to the rule) why doe they bind men, by unaequall conditions, to this cuſtom, which they, neither doe, nor can ſufficiently declare to be commanded by Chriſt, or to be warranted by the rule?</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee what he ſayth to the proofes of the juſtnes of their lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blame of this miſcarriage upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, rather then upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Claſſis.</p>
               <p>Firſt. They ſay, <hi>that ſome of the Dutch Miniſters themſelves are willing to caſt off ſome of their cuſtoms, if the vaſtnes of theire Church did not force them thereunto.</hi> Hereunto he giveth two anſwers. 1. that <hi>things ſimply unlawfull are as well to be caſt off in a great Church as in a ſmall.]</hi> Reply. True: it is a duety as neceſſary to be done in the one as in the other, yet, it may more eaſily be done in the ſmaller Churches, and therefore the ſinne of the ſmaller Churches is the greater, if they doe not caſt off ſuch an unwarrantable cuſtom. The vaſtnes of their Churches doth only excuſe them, <hi>a tanto,</hi> not <hi>a toto.</hi> 2. that, <hi>in the ſmaller Churches in the villages, the ſame order is obſerved.]</hi> But. 1. it hath not bene expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of any of the Miniſters of thoſe Churches (as a condition of their admitta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as it was of me) that they ſhould reſt in ſuch a wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which bindeth them to baptize all that are brought. 2. It may be queſtioned, whether all the Miniſters, in thoſe ſmaller villages, doe ſo promiſcuouſly adminiſter Baptiſme, as they doe, in Amſterdam, ſeing ſuch different ſorts of people are not in thoſe villages as in that Citty.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:20023:145"/>
               <p>Secondly. They ſay, that <hi>one of the Miniſters ſaid to the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werer in the Claſſis (upon occaſion of his complaining of my not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to all their orders) why? you your ſelfe doe not conforme to all our orders.</hi> Hereunto he pretendeth to give five anſwers. I ſay <hi>pretendeth.</hi> For, the firſt anſwer is no anſwer, but onely a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>who told this?</hi> His ſecond anſwer is, that <hi>the mind of the Claſſis is not to be collected by the ſpeech of one.]</hi> Neither doe they ſay that all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are of that mind, but that <hi>one of them ſaid ſo,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it ſeemeth, the reſt ſhewed no diſlike, and ſo ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it, and more then one of them have bene heard to ſay as much as the Complainants affirme. His third anſwer is, that <hi>the ſpeech of the Miniſter is not in right manner repeated by them.]</hi> But, if the matter be right, it is true in the ſubſtance of their report, which is ſufficient, in this caſe, what ever fayling may ſeeme to be in a circumſtance. His fourth anſwer is, that <hi>this one Miniſter undertooke in wrighting to ſatiſfye my objections, and, having replyed to myne anſwer, received no anſwer to his ſecond wrighting.</hi> It is true: I did not anſwer his ſecond wrighting. 1. Becauſe, that wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting did not ſufficiently anſwer my firſt. 2. Becauſe, at that time, I wrote to the wholl Claſſis, in which reſpect, there was no uſe of wrighting to one member of the Claſſis alone. His fifth anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is, <hi>The nationall Synod, at Dort, in things indifferent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Kercken ordeningh. Art. <hi>85.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>doeth allow Churches of other Nations in theſe Countreys to vary from their cuſtoms.]</hi> It is well they doe ſo, and it is fit they ſhould ſo doe. But, if it be ſo. 1. why was it required of me that I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to all the orders and cuſtoms of the Dutch Church? 2. Why was I not allowed to vary from their cuſtoms, in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of promiſcuous baptizing, ſeing I profeſſed that I could not doe it with a good conſcience, and they gave me no grounds from the Scriptures to ſatiſfye my conſcience, that I might doe it lawfully?</p>
               <p>Thirdly. They ſay, that <hi>the Dutch Miniſters have profeſſed that they ſhould have bene glad that this difference might have bene ended among our ſelves:]</hi> What ſayth the Anſwerer hereunto? Iuſt nothing. And it was his wiſdom to be ſilent here. For what could he ſay? He could not deny it, and the confeſſion of it to be true would diſcover him to have bene a greater impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:20023:146"/> of the Churches deſire, and my accommodation, then he was willing ſhould appeare. And I wiſh, from my heart, he had bene as ſilent in all the reſt, that I might have paſſed by all theſe injuryes in ſilence warrantably.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. They ſay, that <hi>he hath required of the Elders that an order might be made in the Conſiſtory, that whatſoever Miniſter ſhall hereafter be called to that Church, ſhould conforme to that wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the five Ministers.]</hi> Hereunto he pretendeth to give five anſwers, but one good one were worth them all.</p>
               <p>His firſt anſwer is onely a queſtion, as before, <hi>who told this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond anſwer is, in part, negative, but upon an ill ground, viz, <hi>becauſe the Claſſis had already approved and confirmed it.</hi> Concerning the vanity of that pretence enough hath bene ſpoken already, yet, in part, he affirmeth it, in ſaying that he <hi>ſhewed it to be unreaſonable if that order ſhould not be required of any other miniſter as well as of me.</hi> But, ſeing there was no good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it ſhould be required of me, what reaſon is there that it ſhould be required of others? Is it a good courſe to hide an injury done to one by profeſſing to doe the ſame injury to many?</p>
               <p>His third anſwer is, that, <hi>by the motion of a Dutch Miniſter and a ſpeciall freind of myne, &amp;c. the Dutch Miniſters came to his houſe and made that wrighting.]</hi> That Reverend Dutch miniſters love and paines I acknowledge, with all thanckfullnes, and am ſorry that a learned and godly Brother, of another Nation, ſhould ſhew himſelfe more deſirous of myne accommodation then myne owne countryman, from whom, in many reſpects, I had cauſe to expect more favour and love then from forraigners, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeing their labour proved no more ſucceſfull, thorough the violence of a contrary ſtreame, of which enough hath bene ſaid in former Sections.</p>
               <p>His fourth anſwer chargeth me with <hi>untruth in my wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Claſſis that, at his requeſt alone, they did in wrighting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their private judgment.]</hi> But, why did he not, at leaſt, more roundly deny it, if it be untrue? For, it may be true, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing ſayd by him to the contrary. For, why might
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:20023:146"/> not that Miniſter propound it to the reſt being thereunto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Anſwerers private intimations or intreaty? But, ſuppoſe the Miniſter propounded it, of his owne accord, yet, what I wrote is true, in the ſenſe, wherein I meant it. For I ſpake of the Anſwerer <hi>alone,</hi> not in reference to the Miniſters of the Claſſis, but in reference to the Elders of his owne Church, and in this ſenſe it is true, that the Anſwerer (conſidered with the Elders and the Church) did <hi>alone</hi> propound it: the motion came not from the Elders, but from him <hi>onely,</hi> in that ſenſe. But, what is this to the order, which he required the Elders to make in the Conſiſtory, which is the matter in queſtion? Is this a fit place to ſpeake of paſſages betweene the five Miniſters &amp; him, when the Complainants charge him with ſeeking to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious order in the Conſiſtory? Had not the twelfth Section bene a fitter place for this matter, where it is purpoſely ſpoken of? But I forbeare to geſſe at the reaſon hereof. Whereas he addeth, <hi>if he had bene the onely ſecker thereof, there is no cauſe for them, that meane to deale uprightly, to complaine of ſuch a lawfull &amp; ſafe courſe]</hi> I need not to add any thing, in way of Reply thereunto, having already ſaid enough, in the foregoing Sections, to prove that that courſe was, neither ſafe, nor lawfull.</p>
               <p>His fifth anſwer is a mere catching at an advantage, which one expreſſion in their wrighting ſeemeth to give him, I ſay, <hi>ſeemeth,</hi> for it doeth it not really. They ſay, that they <hi>thinck no godly man will abſolutely be bound to conforme to that wrighting.]</hi> To let paſſe his unworthy ſcoffes, he accuſeth them of <hi>a raſh and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious judgment</hi> for ſaying ſo, whereas. 1. they profeſſe onely that they <hi>thinck</hi> ſo. Now, every thought, though it may be raſh, is not to be accounted a praeſumptious judgement. 2. they doe not ſpeake of <hi>ſuffering themſelves to be bound</hi> to ſuch a wrighting, but of being <hi>abſolutely bound to conforme to it.</hi> And there is a great difference betweene thoſe two expreſſions. 3. My name is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together needleſly brought in here, as the Reader may well perceive. But I paſſe it by. But, is his ſeeking to have that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made in the Conſiſtory, to bind all Miniſters that ſhall be called in that Church, proved to be lawfull, and for the good of the Church, by this, or by any thing elſe, he hath ſayd, in the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:20023:147"/> 5 pretended anſwers? If not, It appeareth that no ſatiſfaction is given to the Complainants by his anſwers. And ſo their ſecond proofe of his ſubjecting the Church under an undue power of the Claſſis, which they produce for an evidence of his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having himſelfe as he aught, in his paſtorall government, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth unanſwered.</p>

               <p>IN this Section they produce the third proofe of the juſtnes of their complaint of his ſubjecting the Church under an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due power</hi> of the Claſſis, to wit, <hi>his violent bringing of matters to the Claſſis, when he cannot have his will unjuſtly ſatiſfyed.]</hi> Which complaint they agravate by the dangerous conſequent, or rather effect of it: for, they ſay, <hi>he deſtroyes the power of the Church ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, often affirming, they can doe nothing, in theſe caſes, without the Claſſis.]</hi> And, to prevent an objection againſt themſelves about what they had ſaid concerning the undue power of the Claſſis, they profeſſe their <hi>reverent eſteeme of them for counſail &amp; adviſe in all difficult matters that cannot be ended in theire owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory.</hi>

For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they ſay, <hi>they eſteeme reverently of them.</hi> 2. Nor, that they bring ſuch matters to the Claſſis as cannot be ended in their owne Conſiſtory. But the thing they complaine of, is. 1. that he <hi>brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:20023:147"/> ſuch things to the Claſſis as may be ended in the Conſiſtory.</hi> 2. <hi>that he doeth it violently, that is, without conſent of the reſt.</hi> 3. <hi>that his principall motive, or inducement thereunto, is, the ſatiſfaction of his owne will.</hi> 4. <hi>That he doeth it under a pretence that the Church can doe nothing in ſuch matters</hi> (to wit, as thoſe in queſtion, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an order for a decent and orderly performance of a Religious duety, in a right adminiſtration of baptiſme, and the chuſing of their owne Paſtors, when they pitch upon men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring all haereſy and ſchyſme, &amp;c. and craving the helpe of an aſſiſtant for a time, in the Churches neceſſity) <hi>which,</hi> they truely ſay, <hi>is a deſtroying of the power of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, let us ſee his anſwers hereunto, which are fixe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His firſt anſwer is, <hi>It is no act of violence, but a refuge againſt violence, to refer thoſe things to the Claſſis, which men conceive to be unjuſtly done; or delayed in the Conſiſtory.]</hi> Reply. Violence is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppoſed to that which is juſt, or to that which is voluntary. In their complaint the ſenſe ſeemeth carry it to boath, and ſo, that is violently done which is done, both unjuſtly, and without conſent. That he did it without conſent the Anſwerer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, but denyeth that he did it unjuſtly, and retorteth the imputation of violence and injuſtice upon them, either for doing or delaying ſome thing in the Conſiſtory unjuſtly. He is now become an accuſer of them, and plaintiffe, and therefore, according to his owne rule, is to bring proofe. If he ſay, they did unjuſtly in making orders about ſuch matters (without the conſent of the Claſſis) let him ſhew what rule is tranſgreſſed thereby. This he ſhould have done before he had taken the matter out of their hands, and carryed it into the Claſſis, that they might have bene convinced of the aequity of his ſo doing. If he can not; Let him beare the juſt blame of ſlandering the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory in print, and of depriving the Church of her due power in her owne matters, which the law of God, and the Synodall canons of theſe lands acknowledge to be due to her in things of this nature, as it hath bene formerly declared. And therefore he need not ſcoffingly aſke of theſe Complainants for their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or evidence that he deſtroyeth the power of the Church. Thoſe ſpoken of in Sect. 27. have given it,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.7.</note> if he will give the <hi>dayes</hi> leave to ſpeake, <hi>and the multitude of yeares to teach wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:20023:148"/>2. His ſecond anſwer accuſeth them of <hi>folly,</hi> and that <hi>order</hi> in the Church, which they plead for, according to the ordinance of Chriſt, as a <hi>bondage, ſervitude, burthen, oppreſsion &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. They complaine that <hi>when he can not have his will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſatiſfyed in the Conſiſtory, he violently, without their conſent, bringeth matters thence into the Claſſis.</hi> Jf this complaint be juſt, it is not ſlight. His carriage in late differences maketh it ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that <hi>the roote of the matter is in him.</hi> For let the ground of theſe troubles be conſidered, and it will be found that the thing, for which he contendeth, is not neceſſary: either as a meane for Gods glory, and the Churches aedification, or as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God; nor is it injoyned in any Canon of theſe Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Nationall Synods; nor is it expreſly, and particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, by any Claſſis, of any Dutch Miniſters in their admiſſion. So that it is not difficult to determine from what diſtempered principle theſe diſordered motions have ariſen, and who is to be accounted <hi>burthened,</hi> in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>As for the folly, which he chargeth upon the Complainants, that, <hi>pretending to ſtand for the liberty of the Church, they ſeeke to bring themſelves into bondage;</hi> the queſtion is, whether is the way of liberty or bondage to the Church? That which Chriſt hath appointed? or that which men, without Chriſts warrant, have deviſed? If the way of Chriſt is the way of liberty: the queſtion will be, which is the way of Chriſt? whether that particular Churches have power within themſelves to chuſe a fit Paſtor, and to crave the helpe of one well knowne unto them in time of the Churches neceſſity, &amp; to ſee that Baptiſme be decently &amp; orderly adminiſtred? or that they ſo depend upon Claſſes for their leave &amp; permiſſion herein, as to be hindred by them from doing any of theſe, at their pleaſure? If the firſt is the way of Chriſt; let the Anſwerer beware that he be not found a falſe witneſſe againſt Chriſt, and his wayes in making them wayes of <hi>folly, and ſervitude,</hi> &amp;c. If the latter be the way of Chriſt, let him ſhew it (and not ſay it onely) I ſay, ſhew, and prove it by Scripture, for the ſatiſfaction of the people that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his miniſtry. And till he can doe that, let him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare ſuch expreſſions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third anſwer is by aſking <hi>what men ſhould doe, when
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:20023:148"/> they thinck the Elders to be in an errour?</hi> Reply, If a man thinck them to be in an errour, what ſhould he doe elſe but ſhew them their errour by the word, and, if the caſe prove difficult, crave (with common conſent) the helpe of other mens, or Churches light (as occaſion ſhall require) to make the matter cleare? But the rule warranteth not any man, upon his mere thought that they erre, to carry the matters quite out of their hands &amp; power, without their conſent, or declaring the aequity of his ſo doing to the ſatiſfaction of the Church. For, upon ſuch a pretence, if the Claſſis be partially addicted to the Miniſter, all Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings will be hindred. And hence it was indeed, as Dr. Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon obſerved, that the frequency of Synods did diminiſh the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority &amp; neceſſity of the Conſiſtorian meeting of Elders. For, after that the meeting of Synods twiſe a yeare was ordayned in the Councill of Nice and Calcedon, the Elders began to be in leſſe uſe and account, the Synods as higher judges taking upon them the examination and deciſion of thoſe things, which were wont to be agitated in the preſbyteryes. What he ſayth of the Hierarchicall Synods, in that place, will be found true alſo of the Claſſis, by this courſe, and much more, ſeing they meete ſixe times a yeare.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His fourth anſwer needeth no other reply then what is made already to the like (if not the ſame) pretence in his fifth anſwer, examined in the 23. Section, whereunto J referr the Reader.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His fifth anſwer is already replyed upon in examination of the 27. Section.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His ſixth anſwer alſo is replyed upon before, in ſeverall paſſages, and the vanity of it diſcovered.</p>

And, as for binding men to reſt in their determinations, as if they were infallible, both Dr. Whittaker, and Iunius, in ſhewing that Councills are ſubject to errour, have given ſufficient light for diſcovery of the evill of that practiſe.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee what he anſwereth to this complaint, in ſeaven particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His firſt is, after his uſuall manner, <hi>It is untrue,</hi> but, when, the Church is hindred from making an order for the decent &amp; orderly adminiſtration of holy things, by their owne power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of his taking adviſe of the Claſsis, as it was in the queſtion about Baptiſme, &amp; when J was required (&amp; that for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition whereupon I was to be admitted or refuſed) to reſt in a wright<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng of five Miniſters, no rule being ſhewne me by them from the Scripture to warrant their ſo doing, theſe things ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be true.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſecond anſwer is, that the ſame thing may be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt any Paſtor in the reformed Churches. But this is an injury to all reformed Churches and Paſtors, unleſſe he can
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:20023:149"/> prove that, in the fame particulars, they ſubject their Churches to the ſame undue power of Claſſes, and in the ſame manner as he hath done. Which he never will be able to doe. It is true, that Claſſicall aſſemblies (or ſuch like) are a ſpeciall bond of union and ſinew of government, in them all, but to argue, from the lawfull uſe, to juſtify the unlawfull abuſe of them, is unſound reaſoning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third anſwer is to their charging him with doing this <hi>under a pretence of aſking, and taking adviſe of the Claſſis.</hi> Which he denyeth, and ſayth that he <hi>profeſſeth openly the authority and power of Synods and Claſſis to be lawfull and neceſſary, as well as their counſail and adviſe.</hi> Neither doe they deny the authority, and due power of Synods and Claſſes to be lawfull, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but they complaine of an undue power and authority aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Claſſes by the Anſwerer, and they declare, by inſtances, what that power is which they account <hi>undue.</hi> Now, unleſſe he can prove that power to be due, which they have affirmed to be undue, he hath not anſwered their complaint, which is, that, under pretence of aſking and taking their adviſe, he ſubjecteth the Church under that power, which they affirme to be undue. That he doeth ſo ſubject them hath bene ſhewed, and that he pretendeth onely to aſke, and take their adviſe, his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, both by ſpeeches, at other times, and in diverſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of this booke, declare ſufficiently.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His fourth anſwer is to their ſaying that <hi>the Church never acknowledged any ſuch power to be due,</hi> whereunto he anſwereth, 1. by ſhewing the agreement betweene the ancient Engliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants there, the Magiſtrates, and the Dutch Miniſters, which was <hi>to have ſuch an Engliſh Church as ſhould accord with the Dutch, in the ſame order of Diſcipline and Government.</hi> 2. By decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that, <hi>ſince his firſt comming</hi> (but he ſayth not how long after his firſt comming) <hi>he was admitted to be a member of the Claſſis.</hi> 3. By ſhewing the manner of their receiving members, viz, <hi>by profeſſion of the ſame fayth with them, and by ſolemne promiſe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting to ſubmit unto the diſcipline of this Church according to the rule of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, what is in all theſe paſſages to prove their ſubmiſſion to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:20023:150"/> any undue power and authority of the Claſſis? Nay, when they profeſſe to ſubmit unto the diſcipline of this Church, according to the rule of Chriſt, doe they not therein implicitly profeſſe againſt ſubmiſſion to any undue power of the Claſſis? And, as litle doeth the practiſe of any members ſince, in reſorting to the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, upon occaſion of aſking their judgment in matters contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted among them, eſtabliſh any undue power of theirs. And, to what end ſhould <hi>thoſe that joyne with his Church, leaving their ſeparation, come with a proteſt againſt the undue power of the Claſſis,</hi> when they knew not of their ſubjection thereunto, no more being required of them in their Covenant, at their firſt admiſſion, then ſubmiſſion to the diſcipline of this Church, according to the role of Chriſt? As for that, which he addeth, <hi>of their chuſing rather to continue as they were, then to be of the Engliſh Synod,</hi> this doeth not teſtifye their acknowledgment of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any undue power of the Claſsis. But, how, were they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Claſsis, when, not long before that, the Anſwerer himſelfe (as Mr. Forbes aſſured me) laboured to ſet up an Engliſh Claſsis or Synod, which not ſucceeding, in his indeavour at that time, he never after attempted to procure, nor would joyne with, being after ſet up, at the procurements of others. As for St: Offw: report of Geneva; we have already ſhewne ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the aſſociation of Churches in Geneva, and the Claſſes in theſe Countryes. But, be that as it may, it makes nothing for the warranting of any undue power of the Claſsis.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His fifth anſwer is to that paſſage in the complaint, when they ſay that <hi>the power,</hi> which they complaine of, <hi>is ſuch, as the Scriptures doe not in any place give to ſuch a company of Miniſters.</hi> The fault that he findeth herewith is, that they doe not alleadge any one place of Scripture to condemne the ſame. As though Negative Arguments from Scripture were not ſufficient proofes of the unlawfullnes of a thing in matter of Religion. By the helpe of St. Offw: booke he accommodateth the 15. of the Acts. concerning the Church at Antioch ſeeking helpe of the Church at Ieruſalem, in a difficult queſtion, to the preſent queſtion. But what is that to the undue power of the Claſsis whereof they complaine? In his next anſwer, it may be, he will give me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:20023:150"/> of ſhewing that that very place of Scripture maketh ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt that undue power, which he aſcribeth to the Claſſis, in the particulars complained of, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His ſixth anſwer is to that part of the Complaint, when they ſay, that the undue authority (whereof they complaine) <hi>is ſuch as doeth not become any, except the Apoſtles, that could not erre, to have.</hi> This, he ſayth, is falſe, and abſurd, and, upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he reproveth me for a like ſpeech, <hi>in my letter to the Claſſis, touching my conſent required to the wrighting of the five Miniſters, namely, that ſuch a ſubjection is greater then may be yeelded unto any Councill, whether of Claſſes or Synods &amp;c. that thereby the wrightings and decrees of men are made infallible, and aequall with the word of God, which is intolerable.</hi>

For, ſpeaking of the definitions of Councills concerning matters to be beleived, or to be done, he ſheweth, that to define a thing, ſignifieth, either 1. to declare what we are to beleive &amp; doe, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the authority of the Scripture, becauſe the Scripture teacheth,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:20023:151"/> that it aught to be ſo beleived and done, and that therefore they that beleive or doe otherwiſe, are in an errour. 2. or elſe it ſignifyeth to appoynt and preſcribe, by their owne authority, what we are to beleive or doe, ſo as men muſt reſt in it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever reaſon they have againſt it, and may not beleive or doe otherwiſe. The firſt he alloweth, and ſo did I, and deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to underſtand ſome rule from the word warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me to doe that, whereunto they, in that wrighting, would have bound me. The ſecond way of defining he denyeth to belong to any Councill, and affirmeth that it appertayneth onely to God, and to Chriſt, and to the Holy Ghoſt. Here I might be large in alleadging wrighters of the moſt eminent noate affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the like, and the ſame, for ſubſtance, with me, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and many of them expreſſing their judgments in the ſame words. But theſe ſhall ſuffice, till a further provocation. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Anſwerer demandeth, whether <hi>no truth be uttered or deſcribed by men in our times, whereunto the conſent of men may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired?</hi> But what is this to the matter in queſtion? Had they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be a truth, I was ready to have teſtifyed my conſent with them in it? But that they did not, nor hath he done it in all this taedious diſcourſe. So that this is to argue <hi>ex non conceſſis, from that which is not granted.</hi> Or, will he ſay, that, becauſe every truth uttered by men, muſt be conſented to, therefore we are bound to conſent to every thing which men ſhall utter? And to as litle purpoſe is that which he alleadgeth concerning <hi>the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription which the Reformed Churches require to their confeſſions of fayth;</hi> Whereas the matter in queſtion is not comprehended in any Article of thoſe Confeſſions, and out of thoſe very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions we doe diſpute againſt it. But, was not the Anſwerer driven farr, and put hard to his ſhifts, when, to make ſome ſhew of anſwer, he demanded, <hi>how I could ſubſcribe my name to my owne wrighting ſent to the Claſſis, to ſhew my conſent to it, and whether I did thereby make my ſelfe an Apoſtle, or my wrighting aequall to the word of God?</hi> To let paſſe his improper calling it my conſent to my owne wrighting, my ſubſcription to it was, not in reference to my ſelfe, but to the word of God, whereunto it is conſonant, and it teſtyfyed unto them my perſuaſion that it agreed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:20023:151"/> but, what is this to the ſubſcription, which they required, to injunctions and praeſcriptions, which were not declared to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Scripture, either in that wrighting which they ſent, or in any conference they had with me, though I told them that <hi>unicum Argumentum &amp;c.</hi> Any one Argument from the word ſhould prevayle with me, and that, beſides other times, once in the hearing of ſome of the Elders, and others. But, will it follow, that becauſe a man, upon perſuaſion of the truth, may ſubſcribe to other mens wrightings, or to his owne, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may ſubſcribe to thoſe wrightings concerning the truth whereof he is not perſuaded?</p>
               <p>Whileſt he was wrighting theſe things a ſecret Monitour from within ſuggeſted to him that all humane <hi>judicatoryes are ſubject to errour, and that, when that errour is ſhewed by the word of God, it aught to be corrected.</hi> But, if the queſtion be, who may judge of this errour, and ſhew it them? Here his anſwer is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. He ſayth <hi>one Synod often reformeth that which hath bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by another.</hi> This ſheweth indeed that Synods are ſubject to errour. And doe they not therefore erre becauſe they fetched not their definitions and praeſcriptions from the Scriptures? And is it not the beſt way, for rectifying them, to reduce them to that rule? And how ſhall this be done, but by the courſe which thoſe Noble Beraeans tooke, by comparing them with,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.</note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining them by the Scriptures? And to whom doeth this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long? Indeed the publick Miniſteriall power of judging, in ſuch caſes, belongeth to Synods or Councills themſelves. But the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgment, which Divines call <hi>the judgment of practicall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> belongeth to every Chriſtian. So that no man is bound abſolutely to ſubmit to, or to reſt in the judgment of any man or Councill, but to trye them by the Scripture, and to conſent with them no further then they appeare to conſent with that rule.

               <p>IN the eight following Sections I find nothing which I am by name called to examine, excepting that here and there my name is mentioned in his repeating things already ſufficiently cleared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely in the 39 Section, whereas they complained of manifeſt injury done by the Anſwerer to me, whom he reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in publick about the meeting of diverſe to heare me upon the grounds of Religion in Catechiſing the family, where I lived (though enough hath bene ſaid, in the 20 Section, for the ſatiſfaction of the indifferent Reader, about my carriage in that buiſenes.) it will be requiſite, upon a new provocation, to add 2 or 3 words, in this place alſo, for the removeall of ſome inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations injuriouſly caſt in by the Anſwerer to faſten a ſuſpicion of diſorder upon that private excerciſe. For 1. in his ſecond, anſwer, he ſuppoſeth, that I there preached, without a calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas I neither preached (in the ſenſe wherein he taketh the word, viz, by vertue of a publick office in that place) nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that private excerciſe, without a ſufficient calling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, both from the duety of my private domeſticall relation to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:20023:153"/> my owne family, and from the deſire of the Maſter of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, where I then lived, to thoſe of his houſhold, and whereas others deſired to partake of the benefit of it, their deſire was calling ſufficient for their admittance to that private excerciſe, by vertue of the ſpirituall relation which all Chriſtians have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually among themſelves, and the right which thereby they have to communicate in the gifts and labours of one another, for their aedification. So that, even for this cauſe, there was good reaſon for them and me to be offended at ſo publick a ſlander of that action, and of our intentions therein. As for the place of Scripture miſapplyed by him, out of Mat. 28.19, to reprove this duety; it doeth not forbid private men any duety, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof is required in other texts. as. 1. Maſters to their owne familyes in inſtructing them. Deut. 6.7.9. Deut. 11.19.20. Gen. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. Eph. 6.4. Phil. 2. 2. every Chriſtian, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his gift, for the helpe of others 1. Pet. 4.10. Heb. 10.24.25. Mat. 3.16. 3. If yet the Anſwerer is not ſatiſfyed, let him know that more may be pleaded, for the warrant of that action, in reference to me, even from that place of Scripture, then I will inſiſt upon, if I would plead all that I might, or indeed need to make uſe of, ſeing it was a mere private excerciſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, according to my meaſure of gifts, with good warrant of the fore named texts, and not falling within the meaning of that text, which he miſapplyeth, in reproach againſt me. So that <hi>the word of the Lord</hi> is not <hi>made a reproach to him,</hi> but I may ſay, that, for the diſcharge of a Chriſtian duety, I <hi>have borne reproach.</hi> Neither was that the onely ſermon wherein I was reproached by the Anſwerer in publick, as many can teſtifye, which I ſtrove to beare with patience, and ſhould ſtill have borne in ſilence, if he would have ſuffered me to be quiet, at laſt.</p>
               <p>In his third anſwer he girdeth at another, whoſe name he mentioneth not, but the accuſation is anſwered in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 24. 25. 26. Sections,</p>
               <p>In his fourth anſwer, to make good his publick reproaching me, he quarrelleth the name given to that excerciſe, when it is called <hi>catechiſing a family,</hi> which he calleth <hi>a mockery,</hi> but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth nothing to prove that name to be unfit for that action,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:20023:153"/> nor that action ſo done, to be unlawfull, but venteth his paſſion, becauſe he wanteth Arguments againſt it.</p>
               <p>In his fifth anſwer he ſayth, that, <hi>not he, but the Claſſis deprived them of thoſe meetings,</hi> whereas I acknowledge no ſuch power to be due to the Claſſis, nor ever did they ſpeake with, me about it, nor did I ceaſe for any meſſage left by them with Mr. Wh. nor would I have given place, by ſubjection to them, to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from that worke, in acknowledgment of their juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſuch caſes: but when I heard that the Anſwerer tooke of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at it, and traduced it, by private whiſperings, as tending to ſchyſme, and when I ſaw that my ſtaying in that place was a burthen to him, that I might not ſeeme to give offence to him, onely, for peace ſake, I removed my dwelling to another part of the country, where I might be quiet, and ſo, not the Claſſis, but he onely was the cauſe of the ceſſation of that meeting.</p>
               <p>In his ſixth anſwer he chargeth ſome that reſorted to that meeting with <hi>offenſive &amp; ungodly ſchyſming from the Dutch Church,</hi> how truely let him ſee to it. For my part, I never heard that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were guilty of that crime, nor doe beleive it to be true.</p>
               <p>In his ſeaventh anſwer he ſuppoſeth that <hi>our owne conſciences told us that it was not right, which we did, ſeing at the word of man, we left it.</hi> Thus am I as one that holdeth the wolfe by the eare, when I have to doe with ſuch a ſpirit, which, whether a man hold or let goe, will not ſpare. But I will anſwer him in two words, by remembring him that Chriſtian actions are of two ſorts. 1. Actions of Chriſtian duety. Theſe muſt be done, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall diſlike them. 2. Actions of Chriſtian liberty. Theſe may be done or omitted, according to conſiderable circumſtances. To apply this. For one to inſtruct his family by catechiſing, or otherwiſe, or for Chriſtians to communicate their gifts for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall aedification, theſe are neceſſary duetyes which no man may forbid: and, if they ſhall; yet they muſt not be omitted. But to receive ſuch and ſuch a number of perſons, is ſo in our liberty, as, in caſe of offence, we may omitt it. And, upon this warrant, I deſiſted, not from the duety (which I have occaſionally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:20023:154"/> ſince, when J have bene in that houſe) but from perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it in the preſence of ſo many. But let them, who, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king offence unjuſtly, hindred the good of many, provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their account to our Lord Chriſt, in that day when hidden things ſhall be declared, when they, and I, and the poore ſoules that are greived for their hindrance ſhall appeare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before his righteous tribunall. In hope and expectation whereof, is my comfort in the middeſt of theſe troubles (as it was Iobs,<note place="margin">

               <head>The <hi>40.</hi> Section examined,</head>
               <p>IN this Section the Complainants ſhew themſelves aggreived for his pulpiting againſt me, in a reproachfull, uprayding manner, about the point in queſtion. Which they aggravate. 1. By his not ſatiſfying their expectation. 2. By my profeſſed diſagreement with the Anabaptiſts, and Browniſts in this point, with whom, he nevertheleſſe injuriouſly joyned me. 3. By his ſiniſter intent in thus falſely traducing me, viz, <hi>to juſtifye his keeping me out of the Church.</hi> 4. By the injury done to the Church hereby, in that they are deprived of me, whom they much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and bewayle their want of me. Laſtly they ſhew the aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their complaining againſt the Anſwerer for this, by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to worke the Miniſters of the Claſſis to further his purpoſe, telling them, that to tolerate me, in a different practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, would be a condemning of their owne practiſe, and that therefore, if they would give way to me, <hi>they muſt make an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to condemne their owne practiſe,</hi> or to that effect, This is their complaint. Let us now conſider his anſwer.</p>
               <p>Hereunto he pretendeth ten anſwers; but they are ſuch as (to ſay no worſe) I marvayle he would print them.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:20023:154"/>
               <p>His firſt anſwer is, that <hi>it is no reproach to call my aſſertion an errour, Reply.]</hi> But. 1. To call that an errour which he hath not proved, nor can prove to be an errour, is a reproach. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth <hi>it is no reproachfull uprayding of me, unleſſe they could convince him of errour for ſo ſpeaking,</hi> Enough hath bene ſaid in the twelfth Section, and more may be added hereafter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, unleſſe he be of his mind who ſaid <hi>non perſuadebis etiamſi perſuaſeris, though you doe convince, yet I will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</hi> 2. To ranck the party, whom he ſuppoſed to erre, with Anabaptiſts and Browniſts, when he profeſſeth, and is ready to declare that he differeth from them, is a reproachfull uprayding and injurious 3. To doe this in the pulpit, where the people expect nothing but words of truth, and paſſages ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to peace and aedification, and from whence a publick brand of reproach and diſgrace may be left upon a brother, was a more rude expreſſion, then the Complainants uſed concerning their thought that no godly man will be abſolutely bound to ſubſcribe to that wrighting. 4. It is a poore evaſion when he inſinuateth that <hi>I ſaid in effect Mr. Hook: was in errour, when I ſaid that I was not of his opinion in ſome points.</hi> For, to ſay ſo much onely declareth that myne opinion differed from his, but not that he was in errour, ſeing that difference might ariſe from my not underſtanding him aright, not from his diſſenting from the truth. And it ſavoured of modeſty in me, that I would not charge him with errour, from whom I differed in opinion, which is farr from juſtifying, and ſerveth juſtly to reprove the reproachfull ſpeeches of the Anſwerer, as a ruder language.</p>
               <p>His ſecond anſwer is, that <hi>he performed his promiſe, and ſaid enough, in that ſermon, to ſatiſfye their expectation by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, againſt myne opinion</hi> (as he calleth it) and, for proofe hereof, referreth his Reader to his <hi>noates which he wrote downe of purpoſe,</hi> and it is like, keepeth by him of purpoſe alſo. The iſſue of all is, <hi>the aſſertion of thoſe men is falſe and erronious, that complaine he avoyded the queſtion betweene us.</hi> The ſermon here ſpoken of, it ſeemeth, was preached when I was abſent, and, out
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:20023:155"/> of towne: therefore I can ſay nothing, upon myne owne knowledge, in this matter, but that the conſtant report, wherein all, whom I heard ſpeake of it, concurred, was, that what he ſaid was ſo farr from ſatiſfying them, that they did not conceive that he ſpake to the point in queſtion, but evaded it rather. And thoſe noates of his ſermon, which ſome of them tooke from his mouth, and ſhewed me, did apparently make good, in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, what they ſaid. But, if the Reader ſhall be pleaſed to examine his ſtating of the queſtion, in this very Section, and to compare it with the true ſtate ſet downe by me in the 12. Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will eaſily appeare that he did not deale againſt my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (as he calleth it) in every Argument, nor in any Argument as he ſhould. For the difference betweene him and me was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my refuſing to conforme to the cuſtom of the Dutch Church, in that place, in baptiſing all that are preſented, by whomſoever, though the parents were neither of them mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any Church, nor at all knowne unto us. Now he brought not one Argument to prove the lawfullnes of this cuſtom, or to convince me of ſinne for not binding my ſelfe, by ſubſcription, or promiſe to conforme to it.</p>
               <p>His third anſwer is, that, <hi>upon his motion, I made an offer of ſhewing how farr I differed from the Browniſts, which I performed not, which he ſayth, if I had done, myne opinion muſt have fallen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it.]</hi> But it is neither ſo, nor ſo. For, neither did I offer it, upon his motion, but upon myne owne motion, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my aſſertion from his calumnies, nor is there ſuch affinity betwixt their opinions and myne, in this matter, that, <hi>like twinnes, they muſt live and dye together.</hi> For, what I affirme will ſtand, upon other grounds and principles, then thoſe whereby their ſeparation is upheld. To wipe off this aſperſion I will ſhew that it is an injury, as to me, ſo to the truth alſo, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, when it is affirmed that <hi>the errour of the Browniſts could not be refuted by me but that myne owne opinion muſt fall together,</hi> and that, <hi>like twinnes, they muſt live and dye together.</hi> For, I ſuppoſe, the errour of the Browniſts, which he meaneth, is, <hi>that ſeperation from the Church aſſemblies of England, in ſuch ſort as to have no ſpirituall Communion with them, is neceſſary.</hi> If ſo; I demand,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:20023:155"/> how doeth this aſſertion of the lawfullnes of admitting onely their infants to baptiſme, who are members of a true Church, neceſſarily argue ſuch ſeperation from true Churches (for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and corruptions which are found in them) to be a bounden duety? If yea; let him demonſtrate. 1. How it ſtrengtheneth them in theyre refuſing private Religious Communion with good Chriſtians, becauſe they ſtand members of ſome pariſh-Church in England, which is one errour held by ſome of them, as he knoweth. 2, How it confirmeth them in refuſing to heare the word preached by any miniſters of any of thoſe Churches, which is another errour maintained by many of them alſo? 3. How it eſtabliſheth any man in refuſing any publick Religious communion with any true Church? If nay; let him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ſlander. But, that the vanity and untrueth of this ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion may be more evident, I will declare the truth, in this matter, by manifeſting, both myne owne judgment about the truenes of Churches, and the practiſe of the Seperatiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Myne owne judgment and perſuaſion I will expreſſe in Dr. Ames his words thus.<note place="margin">Second Manuduct p. <hi>33. 34.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>So many pariſh aſſemblies of England as have any competent number of good Chriſtians in them united together for to worſhip God ordinarily in one ſociety, ſo many have eſſentiall and integrall forme of a viſible Church, and all they have intire right to Chriſt, and to all the meanes of injoying him: however they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the purity of their combination, and in the compleate free excerciſing of their power.</hi> To prevent all miſtake, he declareth what he meaneth by eſſentiall and integrall forme thus. <hi>The eſſentiall forme of a viſible Church is the covenant of God, or true fayth made viſible by profeſſion; the noates and markes whereof are the word and Sacraments rightly adminiſtred, and received with fruits of obedience. The integrall conſtituting forme is that ſtate, relation, or reference which a Congregation of ſuch profeſſours have one to another by vertue of their ſetled combination, the noate or marke whereof is their uſuall aſſembling together into one place, and watching one over another.</hi> So that, however the defects and corruptions, in thoſe Churches, are to be witneſſed againſt, and howſoever it is the duety of Chriſtians to indeavour (as much as in them is)
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:20023:156"/> to procure the reformation of thoſe defects, and not to partake in the ſinnes of any Church.

                  </note> ſo farr as they are able (as the ſame lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wrighter ſayth, elſewhere) yet to diſchurch them wholly, &amp; to ſeperate from them, as no Churches of Chriſt, or to deny baptiſme to the infants of their knowne members is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by any rule in the Scripture, that I know, nor juſtifyed by my aſſertion or practiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The practiſe of the Seperatiſts themſelves ſheweth that this aſſertion doeth not ſtrengthen or countenance <hi>the errour of the Browniſts</hi> in matter of Seperation. For, they profeſſe to hold ſpirituall communion with other Churches, who doe extend the uſe of baptiſme to as great largenes as England doeth, and greater alſo (as I am able, with Gods aſſiſtance, to prove) though they freely witneſſe againſt it, as a diſorder in thoſe Churches, which alſo many Godly learned miniſters of theſe Countryes are ſo farr from juſtifying, that they confeſſe it to be unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and wiſh it may be reformed.

But I may well be ſilent at this time, ſeing others (as I heare) have undertaken it, and a more fit occaſion may be given hereafter, if it be thaught requiſite, but eſpecially ſeing he hath not anſwered Dr. Ames his ſecond manuduction at all, wherein he hath ſaid enough for the clearing of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this matter, nor indeed hath he taken away the force of that litle, which the Doctor ſaid in anſwer to the Rejoynder, though he expreſſed himſelfe, but in few lines, and as anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, on another occaſion, and not dealing profeſſedly againſt the Separation.

               <p>As for his objection, that <hi>I performed not that promiſe, though I had time enough,</hi> my anſwer is, that he, neither required it of me, nor incouraged me ſo to doe, by aſſuring me that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof would end the difference, Nor did it fall fitly in my way to ſpeake of this point, in any Argument which I handled in publick afterwards.</p>

               <p>Reply. Concerning <hi>the wrighting</hi> I have ſpoken ſufficiently in the 2 and 22. Sections, and in other places, wherein I ſhewed how he compelled me to it, for declaration of the truth againſt his unjuſt reports, and how himſelfe, before he heard of any ſuch wrighting from me, had traduced me, in the darke, in a larger wrighting ſecretly ſent to his freind in N.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>ground of</hi> 6 <hi>yeares reſiſtance.</hi> Seing he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me thereunto, in defence of the truth, I cannot helpe it, nor am to be blamed for it, unleſſe it be a fault to beare witnes
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:20023:157"/> to the truth, when I am called thereunto.</p>
               <p>Concerning the collection, which he, in too mercenary a phraſe, calleth <hi>a recompence for my labour,</hi> I anſwer. 1. I received none of it from him; though ſome other Engliſh preachers are put to that charge: ſo that, to him it was a kindnes. 2. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted not with him for any recompence to be made me from the Church, by his meanes; ſo that, in me it was a kindnes. 3. I received no gratification from the Churchſtock, as other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have done, by his procurement. So that the poore had no damage or hindrance thereby, as in ſome other caſes they have had, through his holding up theſe contentions. 4. The moſt of that which was given was from their purſes, whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiouſly calleth my freinds. 5. What ever I received from them they know, I was no gayner by it, when the neceſſary charges of my diet are deducted, and the hire of an houſe, which, at their requeſt, I tooke, but never lived in, thorough his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt me, and for which I was conſtrayned to pay the wholl yeares rent. 6. As he made no allowance towards this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, ſo he propounded it not to others, by them to be conſidered, and when, by others, it was propounded to him, though he hindred it not (for that was not in his power) yet, when he ſaw that they purpoſed to expreſſe their love ſome what liberally, he tooke occaſion to caſt in diſcouraging ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches againſt it, in a ſermon preached by him at that time, when I was abſent, as they, that heard him, told me. 7. Whereas I received that fruit of the love of ſome among them for my 6 moneths labours, in that place, the oppoſition, which the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werer hath rayſed againſt me, hath put me to the charges of thriſe 6 moneths in theſe parts, by compelling me, for peace ſake to remove to ſome other place, where I might live quietly, though upon mine owne charges, whereas, in that place, it was offered me, by ſome of them, that the ordinary allowance, which the Dutch Miniſters receive, ſhould be given me, if I would live amongſt them though privatily. But I preferred peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore outward advantages, and departed thence, to my outward diſſadvantage, and loſſe, through his unquietnes.</p>
               <p>His other anſwers which he pretendeth to make to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:20023:157"/> but thorough them ſmiteth me, are already examined.</p>
               <p>In his fifth anſwer he blameth them for <hi>falſe imaginations tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his thoughts &amp; intents.]</hi> How juſt this reproofe is, his owne conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce knoweth: but he is very unfit to be a reprover of evill ſurmiſes, who is ſo abundantly culpable of the ſame evill in ſo many paſſages of this booke: yea, in the next immediatly prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent paſſage he expreſſed a falſe imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in preaching againſt Schyſming to thoſe that frequented the private excerciſe: wherin he dealt injuriouſly with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; me.</p>
               <p>In his ſixth anſwer he would perſuade the Reader that the Church did not deſire me, after this difference, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the profeſſions of perſons of all ſorts, except Th. All.</p>
               <p>What he ſayth in the 7, 8, 9, &amp; 10 anſwers hath bene examined before.</p>
               <p>The laſt paſſage, in this Sect: concerneth <hi>the preaching and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying of Ia: Cr: and Tho.

                  </note> (viz Ia: Cr.) to ſay ſome thing. Wherefore, paſſing by his ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner of naming them, which is very uſuall with him (though it better became Iulia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pelagian then the Anſwerer) I will onely relate the anſwer which I received from him in wrighting, contracting it thus. 1. That he never read and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Scripture, at any meeting, out of his owne houſe. 2. That in his owne family, he remembreth not that ever there were, in any private Religious excerciſe, above 5 or 6 perſons, of other families, at one time. 3. That he hath not had ſuch meetings above 5 or 6 times, in 8 or 9 yeares. 4. That he remembreth not that any one hath bene at any ſuch duety in his family, theſe 4 or 5 yeares paſt, at leaſt, except ſome allowed miniſter were there preſent. 5. That when they did meet, he did not preach, but read the Anſwerers, or ſome others men labours. 6. That the Anſwerer never admoniſhed him of any fault herein priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, nor did he ever heare that it was diſliked, till the Anſwerer girded at ſuch meeting, in a ſermon, 3 or 4 yeares ſince. 7. That when he ſaw that the Anſwerer had wronged him in print, by an untrue report of theſe matters, he went to his houſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him privatly thereof, but departed thence without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. 8. That a few dayes after, as he heard, the Anſwerer ſaught for witneſſes, and found 2. (as it was ſayd) Ia. Cr. ſpake
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:20023:158"/> with them boath, and found the one very defective, and more againſt the Anſwerer then for him. The other ſaid that, about ſome 5 yeares ſince, he heard Ia. C. read in the bible, and ſome wrighting concerning it, but whether the Anſwerers ſermons or any other, he dare not ſay. But Ia. Cr. conſtantly affirmeth, that this witnes was never at his houſe at ſuch an excerciſe. If this be ſo, let the Reader judge whether this action deſerveth to be ſo cenſured, or publiſhed.</p>
               <p>In the 41 Section I find my name but thriſe mentioned. That which he ſayth of me, in his fifth anſwer, is a direct contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that which he ſaid of me in the 14 &amp; 15 anſwers of the ſecond Sect. The other paſſages in this Sect. which concerne me are anſwered.</p>

                  <head>His anſwers to Allegations of Scripture brought by me examined.</head>
                  <p>BEfore I ſearch into the particulars of his anſwer I have juſt cauſe to complaine that my Tenet, in this queſtion, is not propoſed but mangled, and counterfait, &amp; that, though ſome prints &amp; lineaments of it are repreſented, yet, not in their true decency and proportion: like certaine loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſes, which repreſenting the viſage miſhapen, yet, after a ſort, praeſerve ſomething of the hue &amp; complexion. Which will appeare by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring what is here ſaid by him with that which I then wrote to the Claſſis, which, becauſe it was large and in lattin, &amp; a private wrighting, I forbeare now to publiſh, till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provocation. Whereby the learned may ſee, 1. What mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes were in the Tranſlation, as it was publiſhed, in that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pamphlet, againſt which I proteſted in print. 2. That my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in wrighting to the Claſſis, was, not to diſpute the point, but to declare paſſages betweene the Anſwerer and me, for the removeall of calumnies which had bene caſt abroad among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 3. That the 4. firſt Scriptures were alleadged, not to prove that no infants ſhould be baptiſed, whoſe parents are not members
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:20023:158"/> of that Church, but to ſhew, that they had no power to require any more of me then to performe the duetyes of the paſtorall office, to the members of that Church (whereunto I ſhould have relation) which I was ready to performe. So that my wrighting ſerved onely to prevent that trouble, which I foreſaw would follow, if the Claſſis, to gratifye the Anſwerer, ſhould aſſume to themſelves an undue power of binding me to reſt in,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. 13. 14.</note> &amp; confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to that wrighting ſpoken of before. And that ſuch power is unjuſtly aſſumed by the Claſſis I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>That power which exceeds the bounds of Apoſtolicall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is unduely aſſumed by any Claſſis.</p>
                  <p>But the power of binding a Paſtor to performe a duety of his paſtorall office unto thoſe who are not members of his Church exceedeth the bounds of Apoſtolicall authority.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the power of binding me to baptiſe thoſe that are no members of that Church, whereunto J ſhould be Paſtor, is unjuſtly aſſumed by the Claſſis.</p>
                  <p>Which propoſition will he deny? Not the firſt, unleſſe he will affirme that the Claſſes have a greater power over particular Churches then the Apoſtles had. Which, J thinck, he will not ſay, much leſſe goe about to prove. Will he deny the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Thoſe 4 texts of Scripture were alleadged by me for the proofe of it.</p>
                  <p>To prevent all miſtakes, I pray the Reader to be informed that my intent, in alleadging theſe Scriptures, was onely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe the Miniſters of the Claſſis that they have no authority to exact this of me, as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of my admitta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to that paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charge (as my very words in that wrighting declare) not to ſhew the unlawfullnes of my baptiſing any that are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that particular Church: for I profeſſe, in expreſſe words after, that, <hi>in regard of the communion of particular Churches among themſelves, I neither did, nor doe refuſe to baptiſe their infants, who are not members of that Church: ſo that I may be ſatiſfyed that they are indeed Chriſtians.</hi> So that the queſtion is onely, <hi>whether the Claſſis hath power to exact ſuch a thing of any miniſter to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a particular Church amongſt them, as a condition of his admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</hi> Jn this caſe, I might have put them upon ſhewing their warrant and commiſſion for their ſo doing (as I now doe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the Anſwerer, when he ſhall defend his pretended anſwer,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:20023:159"/> in his next booke) but, to make ſhort worke, I then produced the Apoſtles practiſe, whoſe commiſſion was larger then any Claſſis hath received, and ſhewed that they never aſſumed ſo much, which they would not have fayled to doe, in one place or other, the neceſſity of the Church, in thoſe times, ſo requiring, nor to have recorded it, for the inſtruction of poſterity, if they might have done it. To this end I noated three places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Let us now conſider them, and his anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Text. Acts. 20.28. Wherein Paul charged <hi>the Elders of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus to take heed unto themſelves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt had made them Overſeers.</hi> Where, he did not extend the excerciſing of their office farther then the Holy Ghoſt exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their relation. Let us examine his eight anſwers, which he giveth, rather by number then by weight.</p>
                  <p>His firſt anſwer is, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> to the man more then to the matter. For he ſayth. <hi>By what right Mr. D. himſelfe, being no member of this Church, did communicate with us in the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, by the ſome right may a Paſtor excerciſe his Miniſtry, in ſome acts of it, to thoſe who are no mrmbers of his Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. This anſwer is nothing to the matter in queſtion, For, 1. the queſtion is not, what I may lawfully doe, but what the Claſsis may warrantably exact, in manner aforeſaid. For, ſome lawfull things are arbitrary, and in our liberty, and to be done ſometimes, and ſometimes omitted, as circumſtances and reſpects vary the caſe, and thoſe no man may impoſe as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It had bene more to the purpoſe if he could have ſaid. By what right the Claſsis did compell him to adminiſter the Lords ſupper to unknowne perſons, that are no members of his Church, &amp;c. by the ſame right they may compell me to baptiſe the infants of thoſe that are no members. 2. The caſes are not alike, betweene myne admittance to communicate at the Lords table, &amp; the admittance of thoſe to baptiſme, concerning whom the queſtion is. For J conceive, that (beſides my relation elſe where, and the right which theſe Churches give to knowne paſſants, of being admitted to the communion, for a ſhort time) both himſelfe, and the wholl Church, acknowledged me for a member with them, for the time of my abode in that ſervice, which they teſtifyed by deſiring the helpe of my publick la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and their chearfull admittance of me to that ordinance, during that time, without the leaſt ſcruple. Now, let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:20023:159"/> judge, whether it be alike to receive a man ſo knowne, and acknowledged among themſelves as a member (for a time) to communion in the Lords ſupper, and the baptiſing of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, whoſe parents are members, neither of that Church, nor of any other, for aught any man knoweth, being not at all knowne unto the Church.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond anſwer is, that <hi>the Apoſtle might have layed upon them a further duety, in ſome other place, though no more was required, in that place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply 1. If he would have anſwered to the purpoſe, he ſhould have produced ſome other place, wherein the Apoſtle did ſo: but that he did not, becauſe he could not. 2. That Paul did not impoſe any ſuch injunction upon the Paſtors of Epheſus, at this time, being to leave them, nor afterwards in the Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le which he wrote to them from Rome, nor at any other time (which the Scripture mentioneth, and it would have bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, if it had bene done, being a matter of ſuch moment, &amp; no where elſe in Scripture propounded) wherefore was it, but becauſe he received no ſuch command from the Lord? Which if he had done, it ſtood not with his faithfullnes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act:</hi> 20.20. <hi>v.</hi> 27.</note> who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to <hi>keepe back nothing that was proffitable, and to declare all the Counſell of God,</hi> to conceale. 3. That, neither Paul, nor any of the Apoſtles could impoſe any ſuch injunctions upon Paſtors,<note place="margin">The <hi>5.</hi> booke of the Church. Chap. <hi>27.</hi> p. <hi>497.</hi> Cartw. <hi>1.</hi> Repl. p. <hi>43.</hi>
                     </note> I prove thus. Becauſe it had bene to confound the Apoſtolicall and Paſtorall office, &amp; to bind men to breake the limits of their office, which had bene a violation of Gods order, as D. Feild and Mr. Cartwright ſhew, whom it concerneth the Anſwerer to anſwer in this point.</p>
                  <p>His third anſwer, he ſayth, is more particular, but, I ſay, it is no more to the purpoſe, then the former. He ſayth. <hi>The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word is a Miniſteriall act, which Miniſters are bound to performe to ſome without, when they invite Heathens, Turkes, or Iewes to heare them. Pro: 9.3.4.5. Mat. 28.19.20.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. But, 1, what is all this to prove that the Claſſis hath the authority whereof the queſtion is? Bring it into a Syllogiſme, and ſee. 2. For the Aſſertion it ſelfe, though I grant that the preaching of the Goſpell by a Miniſter is an act of his miniſtry,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:20023:160"/> yet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov:</hi> 9.2.3.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Dan:</hi> 12.3</note> it is not ſo in every man. For one that is not one of wiſdoms maydens, by vertue of office, yet may be one of wiſdoms child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, whom God may bleſſe in the excerciſe of the gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his ſpirit to be an inſtrument of <hi>turning many to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> And, for that other place in Mat. 28.19.20. I know not to what purpoſe it is alleadged, unleſſe to ſhew that the Claſſis may give ordinary Paſtors ſuch a commiſſion as Chriſt gave the Apoſtles, to <hi>goe and preach the Goſpell to all Nations.</hi> 3. To what end doeth he ſpeake of preaching the Goſpell to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Iewes, and Turkes, in this queſtion? Is it to intimate that Baptiſme may be as lawfully adminiſtred to the infants of ſuch, as the word is preached to their parents? Or, what other uſe ſerveth it to?</p>
                  <p>His fourth anſwer is, that <hi>the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, is alſo a duety of the miniſtry to be performed by a Paſtor to more then the members of his particular Congregation, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply 1. Here againe I muſt continue and renew my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that the Anſwerer proveth not the power of the Claſſis in the particular in queſtion. 2. To admit thoſe that are knowne members of another Church to communion in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, upon fitting occaſions, I hold lawfull, and doe profeſſe my readines to practiſe accordingly, but, is this any thing to thoſe who refuſe to joyne with any Church (concerning whom, and ſuch like the queſtion is) Is the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a duety of the miniſtry to be performed by any Paſtor to ſuch? If he ſay, yea; let him prove it. If nay; why then am I blamed for refuſing it?</p>
                  <p>His fifth anſwer is ill bottomed, upon a falſe ſuppoſition, that <hi>the practiſe of the Church at Antioch, in ſending to the Church of Ieruſalem, warranteth Claſſes to excerciſe ſuch authority over par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches as is now queſtioned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. 1. I ſay, it is ill bottomed. For, it will be hard for him to prove, 1, that meeting to be Claſſicall, which was but of 2 Churches conſulting upon an extraordinary occaſion in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult caſe. 2. That this meeting conſiſted of Miniſters onely, ſeing the text ſayth that, <hi>at Antioch, they gathered the Church</hi> Act: 14.27. What was that? <hi>the multitude.</hi> Act: 15.30. and, <hi>at
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:20023:160"/> Ieruſalem, the Church, Apoſtles, and Elders are joyned together in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thoſe meſſengers.</hi> Where the Church againe ſignifyed <hi>the Multitude.</hi> v. 12. who are alſo called <hi>the wholl Church and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> v. 22. 23. 3. That thoſe that dwelt at Ieruſalem dealt in the caſe of thoſe at Antioch by way of Claſſicall juriſdiction and authority, ſeing Paul and Barnabas were ſent, who were not inferiour to the reſt of the Apoſtles, either in authority or in the infallible direction of the Holy Ghoſt, and they were ſent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for the ſtopping of the mouths of thoſe Seducers, which pretended that they were ſent by the Apoſtles, as the Apoſtles intimate in their epiſtle to the Church at Antioch. Act. 15.24. 4. That the Claſſes have power to impoſe their decrees upon other Churches, that have no delegates with them, as the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les did at that time, upon all the Churches of the Gentiles. v. 23.28. Cap. 18.4. 2. As his anſwer is ill bottomed, ſo it is ill built, unleſſe he can prove that it is a part of every miniſters office to be excerciſed in governing the members of many other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations (as well as his one) combined in Claſſes, which he doeth not goe about to doe, nor will be able out of Scripture, where no ſuch property of a miniſter is expreſſed, either in the Acts, or Epiſtles of the Apoſtles. 3. As his anſwer is ill bottomed, and ill built, ſo is it ill added to prove the power of the Claſſes in the matter, concerning which the queſtion is, which it doeth not prove at all.</p>
                  <p>His ſixth anſwer, wherein he pretendeth to come nearer to the place Act. 20.28. (and ſo he had need to doe: for hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he hath gone farr enough from it) is, that <hi>the flock is attended by the labour of the Paſtor, that it may be increaſed, which is done by the labour of faithfull miniſters ſeeking to bring thoſe into the fold, which, at firſt, are no members of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. 1. If all this were granted, yet it will not conclude the point in queſtion, as will appeare to him that ſhall frame it into a Syllogiſme. 2. It may be queſtioned whether this draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the fold be the paſtorall attendance there meant, though I doubt not that it is lawfull, and a duety, but it ſeemeth not to be intended in that charge left with the Paſtors of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. 1.

Becauſe the labour of bringing in others into the fold hath bene undertaken by thoſe that were not Paſtors, with bleſſed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, the Lord giving this glory to his owne word made effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by his ſpirit, and not limiting it as a priviledge peculiar to any office in the Church. And therefore even thoſe out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice alſo are bound to labour in it.</p>
                  <p>His ſeaventh anſwer is that <hi>to aſſiſt a Church, that is deſtitute of their Paſtor, in convincing erronious perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Reply 1. Here againe ſomewhat is ſaid, but nothing to the point. For, will it follow that, becauſe a Miniſter may helpe a neighbour Church, in convincing thoſe that erre, that therefore the Claſſes have a right to exact of me, as a condition of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to the paſtorall office, to baptiſe thoſe infants whoſe parents are not under my paſtorall charge? 2. Though it be true that it is required of a Paſtor to be able to convince erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious perſons, and that, when he doeth it, according to Chriſts order, it is a part of his paſtorall worke, yet, will it follow, that whereſoever he excerciſeth that ability, he doeth execute a part of his paſtorall office? If not, to what uſe ſerveth this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe?</p>
                  <p>His eighth anſwer is, that <hi>my profeſſion of my readines to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe their infants, who are not members of this Church, if I may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfyed that they have a right to it, by their memberſhip elſewhere, in regard of the communion among particular Churches, doeth plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute my ſelfe,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. 1. The thing that I queſtion is the power of the Claſſis to bind me to ſuch a condition. 2. Suppoſe I had expreſly denyed them to have this power, as indeed, I doe, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in the places of Scripture alleadged by me againſt it,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:20023:161"/> how doeth this profeſsion <hi>plainely,</hi> or darkely, or at all refute that? He ſayth, <hi>diverſe wayes.</hi> 1. <hi>Then it is an errour to thinck that a Paſtor may not excerciſe his miniſtry, in ſome acts of it, toward thoſe who are no members of his Church.</hi> But I have already ſhewen that the queſtion betweene us is not whether I may lawfully baptiſe ſuch, but by what right the Claſsis can exact it of me, in the manner aforeſaid. How will he make good this inference? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not lawfull for the Claſsis to exact, it in that manner, therefore is it not lawfull to be done? Or, becauſe he erreth that holds it not lawfull to be done, therefore he erreth who holdeth that the Claſsis may not exact it, after that manner? 2. he ſayth, <hi>It is vayne to call in queſtion, whether they be Chriſtians who are members of a true Church.</hi> But, is not this a vayne anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer? For, how ſhall I know them to be members of a true Church, who are otherwiſe altogether unknowne, without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning with them about it? And as vayne is his third anſwer. For, therefore doe I require a precedent examination of the members of another Church, and not of the members of his Church; Becauſe my relation to that place would have made the members of that Church knowne to me, without ſuch exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but not ſtrangers, who are altogether unknowne. 4. He ſayth, <hi>particular perſons, members of the Catholick or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church may alſo have their infants baptiſed, though not joyned to a particular viſible Church.</hi> Reply. 1. How doeth this ſerve to prove that J plainely refute my ſelfe? For, how can a man be ſaid to refute what he ſaid concerning the members of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, by ſaying nothing about the members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church? Doe men uſe to refute by ſilence, or by ſaying nothing? I wiſh he had ſo refuted the printed pamphlet for his owne credit, and peace, that men might have thought he could have ſaid ſomething, in his owne defence, more then, it now appeares, he can. 2. For the matter of his anſwer. When he ſhall anſwer me what he meaneth by the Catholick Church, whether it be a viſible or an inviſible Church, of which he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, &amp; ſhall give a character or deſcription whereby a man that refuſeth to joyne with any particular viſible Church may be knowne to be a member of that viſible, or inviſible Catholick
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:20023:162"/> Church, then I ſhall have a fit occaſion to tell the reaſon of my mentioning onely the Communion of particular Churches in this queſtion. 5. He ſayth, <hi>that I, having reſigned up my Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charge in London, and not now eſtabliſhed miniſter of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, doe yet, upon occaſion, preach for Mr Balmford, and Mr. Peters</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he would know upon what ground I adminiſter the word to them.</hi>] Reply. 1. What ever the ground be, it will helpe him nothing at all to prove that I have refuted my ſelfe in what I ſaid concerning the power of the Claſsis, in this caſe. 2. Seeing I muſt give my account, take it in few words. I have preached for theſe men, upon the ſame ground, whereupon I preached for him, almoſt ſix moneths together, not by appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Claſsis, nor by vertue of office among them, but, with the conſent and intreaty of ſuch as have authority to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and governe ſuch actions, I have bene willing and ready to imploy my talents, and excerciſe my gifts for the good of many, according to the rule. 1. Pet. 4.10.11. Now I demand. wherein I have refuted my ſelfe?</p>
                  <p>To wind up all theſe extravagancies, like ſo many odd; and broken ends together, into one bottom. My demand to the Claſsis, in reference to their practiſe, was, by what right the Paſtor of a particular Church muſt be bound to performe a worke of his miniſtry to thoſe that are not members of his Church, ſeing the Apoſtles never exacted, required, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it? To this queſtion the Anſwerer pretendeth to make eight anſweres, which muſt be thus expreſſed, or elſe they are not to the queſtion. 1. The Claſsis may exact this of any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by the ſame right that Mr. D. had to come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Church whereof he was not a member. 2. By the ſame right, whereby the Apoſtles required as much, for aught we know, for we cannot find it written. 3. By the ſame right whereby Miniſters are bound to labour the converſion of thoſe without. 4. By the ſame right whereby Paſtors may adminiſter the Lords ſupper to the members of other Churches. 5. By the ſame right whereby the Church of Ieruſalem afforded helpe, in a difficult caſe, to the Church at Antioch being deſired ſo to doe. 6. By the ſame right whereby Paſtors muſt labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:20023:162"/> their flock. 7. By the ſame right whereby miniſters may helpe a neighbour Church to convince erronious perſons. 8. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. D. is willing to baptiſe thoſe infants, being brought to him, whoſe parents are, neither of them, members of any true Church. Is not this queſtion ſoundly anſwered?</p>
                  <p>Or, take my interrogation for a ſtrong deniall of their power to bind me to this condition of baptiſing thoſe who are not members of the Church committed to me, as indeed it was, in my intent. This deniall of their power he accounteth myne er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and he goeth about to confute it by eight Arguments, which muſt be thus framed, to conclude the queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Arg. Mr. D. did communicate with us in the Lords ſupper, being no member of our Church. Therefore the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis may bind a Paſtor to baptiſe thoſe that are not members of his Church. Reply. I deny the Argument.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Arg. Though the Apoſtle required no more of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of Epheſus, but to feede their owne flock, yet he might lay ſome further duety upon them elſewhere. Therefore the Claſſis may bind a Paſtor to baptiſe thoſe that are not members of his Church. Reply. I deny the Argument.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Arg. Miniſters are bound to preach the word for the converſion of thoſe that are without. Therefore the Claſſis may bind a Paſtor to execute his miniſtry to thoſe that are not of his Church. Reply. I deny the Argument.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Arg. Paſtors muſt adminiſter the Sacraments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the Lords ſupper in neighbour Churches that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, being required thereunto. Therefore the Claſſis may bind a Paſtor to execute his miniſtry to thoſe that are not of his Church. Reply. I deny the Argument.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Arg. The Church at Ieruſalem helped the Church at Antioch, in a difficult queſtion. Therefore the Claſſis may bind a Paſtor to execute his miniſtry to thoſe that are not of his Church. Reply. I deny the Argument.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Arg: Paſtors attend their flock, by labouring to increaſe it, and to bring others into the fold. Therefore the Claſſis may bind a Paſtor to execute his miniſtry to thoſe that are not of his Church. Reply. I deny the Argument.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:20023:163"/>7. Arg. Miniſters being deſired, may lawfully aſsiſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches in convincing erronious perſons. Therefore the Claſſis may bind a Paſtor to execute his miniſtry to thoſe that are not of his Church. Reply. I deny the Argument.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Arg: Mr. Davenport is willing to baptiſe the infants that are brought, whoſe parents are members of any true Church. Therefore the Claſſis may bind a Paſtor to performe ſome worke of his miniſtry to thoſe that are not of his Church. Reply. I deny the Argument.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if I would multiply queſtions, which I am unwilling to doe, J could ſhew, in the ſame manner, how litle or nothing he hath ſaid to prove the very thing which he pretendeth to prove, to witt, that it is the duety of a Paſtor to diſcharge ſome worke of his miniſtry towards thoſe that are not of his flock &amp; charge, by denying the Argument in every one of his proofes. But enough hath bene ſaid already, and my deſire is onely to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfye all men concerning what I wrote to the Claſsis, being called and compelled thereunto.</p>

                  <p>Reply. It may ſo, even as fitly as for that, that is, not at all, as hath bene ſhewed in the examination of thoſe Anſwers, onely one thing more we will add, from hence, to what hath bene ſaid. That as the Apoſtles tooke no ſuch power to themſelves, to bind miniſters to doe the worke of their miniſtry to thoſe who are not of their Church; So the Church alſo hath not power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any more of them, and therefore the Claſsis cannot, who have no more power then is given them by the Churches in that combination.</p>

                  <p>As the Anſwerer would have every godly Miniſter conſider whether it be not meete that each of theſe things ſhould be due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded of them: So I could add other conſiderations and obſervations which might be not unproffitable; yet, leaſt I ſhould ſeeme to render reproach for reproach, I will forbeare them, and ſpare him.</p>

                  <p>Reply. The combination of ſhepheards is a good embleme of a well ordered combination of diverſe miniſters. For, 1. it is in common caſes of danger to the flock, or for mutuall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in difficult caſes, as appeareth in thoſe inſtances allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him. Gen. 29.7.8.9. Eſay. 31.4. Luke. 2.8. 2. it is for the good, and helpe, not for the hurt, &amp; hindrance of the flock. 3. no one ſhepheard is ſtreightned in the diſcharge of any paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duety to his flock, or bound to performe the office of a ſhepheard to any other flock, or ſheepe, then thoſe whereunto
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:20023:164"/> he is appoynted by the Lord and owner of the flock, from whom he receiveth his commiſſion. And, in ſuch a way of combination among miniſters, much good may redound to particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to the Paſtors thereof.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. 2. <hi>The word tranſlated feeding doth alſo ſignifye to rule and governe: if this kind of feeding be reſtrained to one Congregation, then is the authority of Claſſes overthrowne, then is it unlawfull for aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of miniſters to give their voyces for the deciſion of controverſies in any Congregation but their owne, contrary to Ezek.</hi> 34.12.</p>

                  <p>Reply. Seing the queſtion is onely of the power of the Claſſis in binding a miniſter, according to the tenour of that wrighting of the five miniſters, and ſeing I acknowledge it to be lawfull, and profeſſe my readines, to baptiſe thoſe that are not members of this Church, if they are members of any true Church, I ſee not how this exception is of any validity againſt any thing ſaid by me, in that wrighting, unleſſe he will accuſe

                  <p>Reply. 1. If this thing be neceſſary to the calling and office of a miniſter, which is in queſtion, it had concerned them, or him to ſhew in what reſpect it is neceſſary, whether by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, which could not be obeyed in the diſcharge of of the paſtorall office, without doing this, or as a meane neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conducing to the ends whereunto the paſtorall office ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. 2. If the Apoſtle will not have men bound to the doing of things indifferent, concerning the lawfullnes whereof they are unperſuaded, much leſſe would he have them bound to that which they judge to be a ſinne, and they, who bind them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, cannot declare to be lawfull, the one thincking it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be avoyded, and the other (what ever they pretend to thinck) not being able to prove it neceſſary to be done.</p>
                  <p>Anſ: 2. <hi>The Apoſtle here ſpeakes of receiving men as brethren, not of receiving men into office. Rom.</hi> 14.3.</p>
                  <p>Reply. What will he inferr from thence? That men may be refuſed from an office, for refuſing to doe thoſe things which Chriſt hath not commanded, and concerning the lawfullnes whereof they doubt, as in the caſe queſtioned, or the like?

                  <p>Reply. Though I ſpake of <hi>doubting</hi> yet I tooke not the word in that ſtrict ſenſe, wherein it is uſed to expreſſe an haeſitancy
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:20023:165"/> betweene aſſent and diſſent, the mind inclining no more to one part then to the other, but, I modeſtly called it a doubt, that I might provoke them to ſatiſfye me with convincing Arguments: yet the Arguments, which perſuaded me of the unlawfullnes of it ſeemed to me not onely praeponderant, but convincing, which the Reader may find in the 12 Section.</p>

                  <p>Other texts of Scripture I alleadged, to expreſſe whom I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be Chriſtians, to witt, ſuch as anſwer that reaſon for which the name was at firſt given to thoſe that profeſſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive in Antioch. Act. 11.21.26. and whom I account the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſtians, namely, thoſe, whoſe parents, at leaſt one of them, in externall profeſſion, <hi>are within the Covenant.</hi> Gen. 17.10. <hi>Faythfull.</hi> Rom. 4.11. <hi>Called.</hi> Act. 2.39. Herein the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werer ſeemeth to agree with me, yet afterwards really diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth about the meanes, whereby that externall profeſſion is made, whence they may be denominated Chriſtians. I deny that the ſaying <hi>yae</hi> at the reading of the Liturgy of Baptiſme pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, or the nodding of the head, or ſome other geſture uſed by perſons altogether unknowne, and that in ſuch a place as Amſterdam, to make ſhew of conſenting to that which is read (and it may be, they underſtand not) is ſufficient proofe of their being Chriſtians. He affirmeth it is. Let us ſee how he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The baptiſing of Turkes, or Iewes, Mahometiſts, or Heathens, or Infidells, of what Nation or Sect ſoever, is not practiſed, nor allowed in the Dutch Church, and if any ſuch caſe, or apparent cauſe of ſcruple had fallen out, then, by the wrighting of the five miniſters, it was permitted to Mr. D. to have referred the baptiſme of ſuch infants to further deliberation, and judgment of the Elderſhip, or Claſſis. And therefore Mr. D. doeth unjuſtly call it promiſcuous baptiſing of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, without difference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. 1. I grant that the children of knowne Turkes, Iewes, &amp;c. are not admitted to Baptiſme, upon the parents ſaying <hi>yea, or nodding the head</hi> &amp;c. nor doe any people ſo groſly, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Chriſtian world; yet nevertheleſſe I doe juſtly call their
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:20023:165"/> manner of adminiſtring this Sacrament, in that place, <hi>promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous baptiſing,</hi> for theſe Reaſons. 1. Becauſe, they profeſſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all that are brought: and who knoweth not that there are of all nations and Sects among them? 2. They take no courſe whereby it may appeare that they make a difference of perſons, either before the diſpenſing of the Sacrament, to know the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or in the time of adminiſtring, no other queſtions being put to unknowne ſtrangers, then are put to the knowne mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of other Churches, or their owne. 3. That, which with them paſſeth for a profeſſion of Chriſtianity, may be done by any Turke, Iew, or Infidell among them: for even they may <hi>nodd their heads,</hi> or <hi>ſay yae,</hi> to they know not what, as well as others, if they have a mind ſo to doe. 4. Though the infants of knowne Iewes, or Infidells are not received, ſeing no care is taken to know who they are, that are preſented, before they be brought in publick, it may eaſily come to paſſe that a nurſe, or ſome other body (without the parents conſent, or knowledge) may bring ſuch infants (and their manner is to admit them, by whomſoever they are brought) and ſay <hi>yae,</hi> or <hi>nodd the head,</hi> in teſtimony of her conſent, out of a ſuperſtitious, and ignorant conceit, that, in ſo doing, ſhe hath made a Chriſtian 5. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of many other perſons are admitted to baptiſme, who have no right to that ordinance, who are no Iewes, nor Turkes, of whom we have ſpoken in the 12 Section, in reſpect of whom alſo it may fitly be called <hi>promiſcuous baptiſing.</hi> 6. Whereas he ſayth, that, <hi>in a cauſe of apparent ſcruple I had liberty to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of the Elderſhip, or Claſſis, about baptiſing, or refuſing thoſe that were brought.</hi> This doeth not at all ſalve the ſore. For. 1. it is too late to take adviſe, when I am put upon the action in publick, I being in the pulpit, as the manner is. 2. what cauſe of ſcruple can be apprehended to be in one ſtranger more then in an other, all being alike unknowne, and one and the ſame forme uſed to all, and all ſpeaking the ſame word <hi>yae,</hi> or uſing the ſame geſture, as <hi>nodding the head?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. 1. I grant that the word, <hi>yea,</hi> in ordinary ſpeech, ſerveth to expreſſe conſent, 2. that it doth ſo many times alſo in matters of Religion. But what is this to the queſtion? The queſtion is not, whether men doe by ſuch an expreſſion teſtifye faith or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but, whether ſuch a teſtification be ſufficient to cauſe men otherwiſe altogether unknowne, to be reputed in the covenant, ſo farr as to procure the admiſſion of their children to Baptiſme? The places alleadged by him ſerve not for proofe of it. For, 1. <hi>Let your communication be yea,</hi>

                     <hi>Beleive yee that I am able to doe this?</hi> In them, <hi>yea,</hi> was a ſufficient anſwer in that caſe. 1. Becauſe it was joyned with ſuitable actions, as their following him, crying to him, and ſaying.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>V.</hi> 29.30.</note> To apply this. I grant that the word, <hi>yea,</hi> is ſufficient to teſtifye their being in Covenant, at the time of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Sacrament, who are ſufficiently knowne, by other tryalls, to have true faith; but, what is this to thoſe who are altogether unknowne? For the 3. Where our Saviour Chriſt, after he had opened diverſe parables, aſked the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:20023:166"/> 
                     <hi>Have yee vnderſtood all theſe things? They ſaid vnto him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.51.</note> 
                     <hi>yea Lord.</hi> Here is no ſpeech about their being in the Covenant. What is this to the matter in queſtion? For, it is not denyed, that by ſaying <hi>yea,</hi> men have teſtifyed their fayth, &amp; ſufficiently, if their faith hath made it ſelfe otherwiſe knowne, as it did in the Diſciples, but it is denyed to be a ſufficient teſtification of faith in perſons who are otherwiſe altogether unknowne. The ſame anſwer may be given to that place in the fourth text, where, to Chriſt demanding, Peter <hi>loveſt thou me?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.15</note> Peter anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, <hi>yea, Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> And Chriſt did know it, by his weeping bitterly for his denyall of him, and by the inward impreſſion which he left upon Peters heart, by his divine power, when he looked upon him in the high Preiſts hall, and before. And ſo, to Chriſt it was ſufficient to ſay, <hi>yea Lord,</hi> and to referr himſelfe to his knowledge of him. But, will it thence follow, that it is ſufficient for us, if any one ſhall ſay ſo? Theſe are the places which he noateth, for the uſe of the word, <hi>yea,</hi> and the Reader may ſee, how litle to the purpoſe. The ſame anſwers may ſerve to his other texts concerning <hi>Amen,</hi> which are needleſly produced, and ſerve not at all to prove the thing in queſtion. As for his other proofes taken from ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as in making of Covenants, <hi>All that the Lord hath ſpoken, we will doe,</hi> or the like, I marvayled much that the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werer alleadged thoſe which make wholly againſt him. For, 1. there is a great deale of binding force in this expreſſion, which is, in no ſort, anſwered by the word, <hi>yea.</hi> 2. it was made by a people whom God had choſen out, from all the world, to be his peculiar ones, upon experience of the admirable paſſages of his fatherly providence, and upon their acquaintance with his wayes, unto whom, the people, againſt whom I have excepted, are, in no ſenſe, to be compared. 3. If the proofe which himſelfe alleadgeth out of Ioſh. 24.15.16. &amp;c. be well examined,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 24.15.16.17 18.19.20 21.22.23 24.25.</note> it will be found, that they not onely underſtood the Covenant, whereunto they bound themſelves, in thoſe ſhort anſwers, but alſo, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was propounded, &amp; their aſſent to it required, in another manner, &amp; with more vehemency, then a mere once declaring of it, on Gods part, or one ſhort anſwer, on their part, ſeemeth to carry with it.</p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:20023:167"/>
                  <p>Secondly. To prove that <hi>nodding with the head, or ſome geſture of the body is a ſufficient teſtification of a mans being in the Covenant, ſo farr as to procure the admiſſion of his child to baptiſme,</hi> he ſearched out the uſe of the latine and greeke words, which ſerve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that geſture, and are uſed to ſhew the conſent, or diſſent of the will in any matter. But, to what purpoſe I know not. For, it is not doubted that ſuch words and geſtures doe <hi>ſignifye the conſent of the will,</hi> nor that they are uſed in the <hi>worſhipping of God,</hi> nor <hi>that ſolemne covenants and profeſſions of ſpeciall perſons in the Church,</hi> are ſo expreſſed, as the <hi>ſtipulation of miniſters, Elders, and Deacons received into office, and the profeſſion of publick repentance</hi> before the Congregation, are accompliſhed with ſaying, <hi>yea, and ſome geſture of body.</hi> But, will all this prove the point in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Surely no. For, 1. the perſons, in the forenamed caſes, are members of the Church, or ſufficiently knowne to the Church, but theſe are, neither of that Church, nor of any other, or not knowne to be ſuch; otherwiſe thoſe expreſſions would not be judged ſufficient, in a doubtfull caſe. 2. they know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is propounded to them, and whereunto they give ſuch a teſtification of aſſent, which many of thoſe, of whom the queſtion is, doe not. 3. the profeſſion, in thoſe caſes, is made by the partyes themſelves, but in this, by any nurſe, or other perſon, in the parents abſence, &amp; yet thoſe alſo are as unknowne as the parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, ſuch parents and ſureties are ſo farr from being knowne to be beleivers, that they are (many of them) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly knowne to live, as without God in the world, in all looſenes and profanenes.</p>
                  <p>In his third Anſwer he ſayeth, <hi>he cometh more particularly unto the places of Scripture alleadged by me.</hi> I wiſh he may be found to doe ſo, in the iſſue, that we may find ſome ground for fayth to reſt upon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt text Acts. 11.21.26. <hi>It is not profeſſed by what words or ſignes they profeſſed their faith &amp; converſion to God. How can it be proved from hence, that ſuch as ſaid, yea, and bowed their heads &amp; bodies, in teſtimony of their approbation, and liking thereof, might not thereupon be admitted to baptiſme, and their infants?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. 1. It is enough that they ſatiſfyed the Apoſtles, that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:20023:167"/> 
                     <hi>they beleived and turned to the Lord,</hi> and that they did ſo in truth appeareth by the teſtimony which the Holy Ghoſt giveth them in that place. It matters not <hi>by what words, or ſignes, more or leſſe, it was done:</hi> but, had there bene no more done then <hi>ſaying yea,</hi> or <hi>nodding the head,</hi> by perſons otherwiſe altogether unknowne, it would not have ſatiſfyed. 1. Becauſe fayth and converſion to God doe appeare, where they are, in more, and better fruits, and evidences then thoſe, as himſelfe, I beleive, would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, if he were to handle that text. 2. Becauſe, more reverent and religious reſpect was had in thoſe times to the ſeales of the Covenant, then to pollute them by ſuch a promiſcuous diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, as is uſed in Amſterdam.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But, what an unreaſonable demand is that? <hi>How can it be proved hence</hi> &amp;c? For, 1. I deny that ſuch a ſaying of <hi>yea,</hi> can be proved, in the Apoſtles times, to be a ſufficient evidence of ones being a Chriſtian, and alleadge this place wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had their name given them at the firſt, wherein I find no ſuch thing. The proofe lyeth upon him, who affirmeth it to be ſufficient, not upon me, who deny it. 2. The force of Negative Arguments from Scripture would be none at all, if ſuch anſwers were any thing worth. For, when, in arguing againſt popiſh deviſes, we bring them to the rule, where no ſuch thing is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, or approved, by this evaſion they might eaſily ſeeme to anſwer any ſuch Argument. For inſtance, when, to ſhew the unlawfullnes of chreame, oyle, ſpittle, exorciſme, &amp;c. in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, we bring them to the inſtitution, and to primitive pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, where ſuch things were not appoynted, nor approved, how eaſily might they anſwer (as he doeth) how can it be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from hence, that ſuch as uſed thoſe things, ſinned in ſo doing? 3. Suppoſe an Anabaptiſt ſhould put him to prove, from that text, that infants were baptiſed, or a Libertine ſhould put him to prove, from thence, that thoſe that were to be baptiſed were preſented in the Congregation, would not he thinck himſelfe unreaſonably dealt withall? To conclude, that place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſufficiently proveth that for which it was alleadged, namely that beleiving and turning to the Lord, are the characters of Chriſtians, and that joyning with a true particular viſible
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:20023:168"/> Church, where it can be done, is an evidence of beleiving and turning to the Lord. For ſo I find them joyned in that Text. Act. 11.26. Let him prove all thoſe, whoſe infants are admitted to baptiſme, in that place, to be ſuch, as, in reſpect of externall profeſſion, may, in the judgment of reaſonable charity, be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſuch, and their <hi>ſaying yea,</hi> or <hi>nodding of the head,</hi> or <hi>bowing the body,</hi> ſhall make no difference betweene us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the ſecond text, Gen: 17.10. <hi>It can not be ſhewed,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>that more queſtions were propounded, in old times, to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed parents, that brought their children to be circumciſed, then are now propounded to thoſe that bring their children to be baptiſed, or that circumciſion was denyed thoſe who ſhewed their conſent and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes to embrace the Covenant, in ſuch breife anſwers and geſtures, as we ſpeake of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. 1. The end for which that text was brought was to ſhew that none were circumciſed but the infants of thoſe that were in the Covenant. How they declared their embracing of the Covenant, if he demand, the Scripture elſewhere ſheweth, viz, by their joyning with the Church of God, in walking accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the lawes delivered unto their fathers by the miniſtry of Moſes. And this they declared more by their workes, in theyre ordinary converſation, then by words at Circumciſion. In which caſe, we will not much ſtand upon words, if the parties are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to any true Church, now under the Goſpell, as they were then to the Church of the Iewes, under the Law. 2. This anſwer is as a ſword, wherewith he woundeth his owne cauſe. For, he ſayth, <hi>they were circumciſed perſons, wbo brought their children to be circumciſed;</hi> and we know, that ſuch were of the Church of Jſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell. But many, for whoſe admittance he pleadeth, are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch parents as are of no Church, and ſome of them may be ſuch, for aught he knoweth, as never were baptiſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Text. Rom: 4.11. This Text was alleadged to ſhew that they muſt be beleivers, at leaſt one of them, in externall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whoſe infants may be admitted to baptiſme, which is (as Circumciſion was) <hi>the ſeale of righteouſnes that is by fayth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againſt this he anſwereth nothing, and hereby doeth tacitly and implicitly confeſſe, that the ſeale properly, &amp; by due right,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:20023:168"/> may be adminiſtred to none but to beleivers, to whom the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes which is by fayth appertaineth, ſo farr as men may, by the judgment of charity, conceive and apprehend, from which, how farr they are, againſt whom we except, is obvious to him that will judge by a rule. Let us now conſider what he ſayth.</p>
                  <p>He ſayth, Abraham is there called <hi>the Father of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, whether they were members of a viſible Church or not. And, for aught we know, that were not of his family, nor under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or guidance of any particular Church. If a ſonne, or bondman of Ephron, or of any Amorite, or Canaanite were then brought unto the knowledge of the true God, why might not the infant of ſuch an one have bene circumciſed, though not living in a viſible Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. 1. All theſe words are beſides the matter: For, if all he ſayth were granted, yet it proveth not that all thoſe may be called beleivers (and ſo Chriſtians) whom they admitt to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which he ſhould have done, if he would have juſtified their cuſtom of baptiſing their infants (under the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians children) who can not be accounted beleivers, according to the ſenſe of this text. 2. His wholl anſwer is made of mere conjectures, which cannot eſtabliſh the conſcience of any man in a well grounded perſuaſion of the warrantablenes of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning the lawfullnes whereof it doubteth, that it may be done in faith. Which to me is a cleare evidence of his want of a rule to beare him out therein, which if he could have found, his expreſſions would not have bene ſo conjecturall, and uncertaine. 3. To the particular conjectures.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. Whereas he ſayth, that <hi>Abraham is the Father of the faithfull whether they were members of a viſible Church or not.</hi> That the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his conjecture, in reference to the matter in queſtion, may appeare, we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the drift of the place, which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, what he had formerly ſaid concerning the ſpeciall univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, or community of the ſubject of juſtification, whereof he began to ſpeake in Chap. 3. v: 22. and afterwards proſecuted v: 29. ſhewing that one &amp; the ſame God, is the God, both of the Iewes and of the Gentiles, and therefore doeth juſtifye them boath, one and the ſame way, to wit, by fayth, though the one be circumciſed, the other not: which he proveth by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:20023:169"/> of Abraham, <hi>to whom faith was imputed for righteouſnes being uncircumciſed,</hi> and, when he was circumciſed, it was not that he might be juſtified by circumciſion, but that the righteouſnes, which he had by fayth being uncircumciſed, might be ſealed to him, by that ſigne. Now, in that Abraham was juſtifyed by fayth before he was circumciſed, hence he became the father of all thoſe that beleive, among the Gentiles, who are uncircumciſed: and, in that he was circumciſed afterwards, that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of fayth might be ſealed to him: hence he became the father of thoſe who beleived among the Iewes, and were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thence the concluſion followeth. Therefore, according to Abrahams example, righteouſnes is imputed to thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive among the uncircumciſed Gentiles, as well as among the circumciſed Iewes. But, in what order cometh Abraham to be a father to the beleiving Iew? In what ſenſe is Abraham called their father? As he is <hi>an example of fayth.</hi> v: 12. and <hi>of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes imputed by fayth,</hi> in this 11. v. And they are called his children who are juſtifyed, according to his example, by belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. And theſe his children are of two ſorts. 1. Inviſible to men, but knowne to God onely. Of theſe the queſtion is not. 2. Viſible to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in reſpect of outward profeſſion manifeſting their fayth. And, concerning theſe, if the queſtion be. In what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is he the father of a beleiving Iew, and he his child? It will be anſwered, he muſt profeſſe the fayth of Abraham, and teſtifye it, by being circumciſed. Now, none were circumciſed but thoſe who were joyned to the viſible Church of the Iewes. In like manner, if it be demanded. In what order is he viſibly the father of a beleiving Gentile, and he his child? The anſwer will be. He muſt receive baptiſme, a ſigne and ſeale of righteouſnes by fayth, which is come into the place of circumciſion: and this belongeth onely to thoſe infants, whoſe parents teſtifye their fayth, by being joyned to ſome viſible Church among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as circumciſion belonged to thoſe onely, whoſe parents were joyned to that viſible Church of the Iewes. So that, though Abraham may be a father (in ſome ſenſe) of many that beleive, who neither are joyned to any Church, or baptiſed; yet viſibly, and, (ſo farr as appeareth to men) he is not a father to ſuch, much
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:20023:169"/> leſſe to ſuch as regard not baptiſme, or refuſe, willfully, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly neglect to be joyned to a particular viſible Church. For, of thoſe the queſtion is. So much of his firſt conjecture.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond conjecture he thus expreſſeth. <hi>For aught we can find, there might be ſome beleivers in Abrahams time, not of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, nor under the government or guidance of any particular Church.</hi> Reply. To what uſe this conjecture ſerveth, I know not. It may be, there were, and, it may be, not. In ſuch caſes, a man may ſafely be ignorant of that, concerning which the Scripture is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. But, ſuppoſe there were; what will he inferr thence? That they were circumciſed, though not of the Iewiſh Church. How will that follow? There may be many beleivers now, in ſome parts of the world, that are not yet baptiſed, and ſo there might be beleivers then, that were not circumciſed. If we ſpeake <hi>de poſſe,</hi> it will not be denyed. What then? Will he gather thence that they aught to be circumciſed, though they were not of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams family, nor joyned with that Church? I deny it, for this reaſon. Circumciſion was a ſeale of the Covenant which God made with Abraham concerning Chriſt that ſhould come, as concerning the fleſh, of Iſaack, and ſo of Iacob, of whom were the 12 tribes, <hi>who were the Iſraelites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom:</hi> 9.4.5.</note> 
                     <hi>to whom pertayned the Adoption, and the glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes: whoſe are the Fathers, and of whom, as concerning the fleſh, Chriſt came,</hi> as Paul ſheweth. So that, as in Abrahams time none were bound to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but thoſe that were of his family, as being borne there,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen:</hi> 17.12.13.</note> or bought, and ſo brought thither, which were not of his ſeed. So afterwards, none were bound to be circumciſed, which were not borne in the family of Iacob, and the Patriarchs, or joyned to them: and after their coming out of Aegipt, none were bound to be circumciſed, but the children of the Iewes, then the onely Church of God, and thoſe that deſired to joyne unto them.</p>
                  <p>His third conjecture is to as litle purpoſe. <hi>If a ſonne of Ephron the Hittite, or of a Canaanite were brought to the knowledge of the true God, why might not the infant of ſuch an one be circumciſed, though not living in a viſible Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:20023:170"/>
                  <p>Reply. It concerneth him to ſhew &amp; prove that he might. For I deny that Circumciſion, by Gods ordinance, belonged to any in Abrahams time, but to thoſe that joyned with his family, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his time, to any but to thoſe that joyned with the onely viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, that then was in his poſterity, deſcending from Iſaack and Jacob, lineally; and this aſſertion I ground upon the inſtitution of Circumciſion expreſſed in Gen. 17. But, as any one then ſo joyning to that Church might be circumciſed, ſo now, they that profeſſe a right fayth, &amp; teſtifye it by joyning with any Church ſo profeſſing may be baptiſed.</p>
                  <p>The 4. Text is Act. 2.39. which was alleadged to ſhew that they muſt be <hi>called;</hi> at leaſt one of them, whoſe infants may be admitted to Baptiſme, becauſe the promiſe belongeth onely to ſuch, whereof baptiſme is the ſeale. And the context ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that thoſe 3000 ſoules declared that they were called. 1. By theire being <hi>pricking in their hearts</hi> for crucifying Chriſt v. 37. 2. By their <hi>joyfull receiving the word</hi> that Peter ſpake to them, concerning repentance, baptiſme, the promiſe, and thoſe other words, wherein he exhorted them to <hi>ſave themſelves from that froward generation.</hi> verſ. 38.39.40. Which joyfull receiving of this word was declared by their joyning together into a Church communion, <hi>wherein they continued ſteadfaſtly, in the Apoſtles doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and prayers.</hi> verſ. 42. <hi>And to this Church the Lord added dayly ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> verſ. 47.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee what he ſayth to this Text. He granteth that the promiſe is made unto ſuch as are called. But concerning the characters of thoſe that are called, he ſeemeth too large in his judgment, for thus he ſayth. <hi>Who can ſhew that ſuch are not to be accounted outwardly called, and in ſome meaſure within the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Covenant, who being themſelves already baptiſed, and withdrawing themſelves from other ſects and Churches, doe bring their infants unto the true Church to be baptiſed, being there alſo ready to make a publick profeſſion of their fayth before the wholl Congregation.</hi> Reply. That I may ſay no worſe, the anſwer is too ſlight, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſubject of the queſtion be reſpected, or the words of the Text. For. 1, he ſuppoſeth that they are perſons already
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:20023:170"/> 
                     <hi>Baptiſed.</hi> But, ſay I, how ſhall that appeare in perſons unknowne, if there be not liberty of a praecedent examination? 2. He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that <hi>they withdrew themſelves from other Sects.</hi> But, what advantageth it that a man withdraw him ſelfe from all Sects, when he joyneth himſelfe with no true Church? Is not he as farr from being juſtly accounted one that is called, who is of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as he that is of a falſe Religion? Who knoweth not, that in calling there are two termes, not onely that from which men are called, namely <hi>the kingdom and power of darknes,</hi>

He ſuppoſeth that thoſe perſons thus withdrawing themſelves from all ſects, <hi>bring their infants to the true Church to be baptiſed,</hi> whereas, 1. it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in their manner of adminiſtring baptiſme, that the parent preſent the infant, neyther, is the parent at all inquired after: it ſufficeth if any one preſent it, though parents and preſenters are alike unknowne. 2. They that bring the infant, doe it not with reſpect to the truenes of the Church, which they ſeldome underſtand, or regard, but becauſe baptiſme is there admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and it is nearer the place where the child was borne, or for ſuch like reſpects. His 4 ſuppoſition is, that the perſons, who preſent <hi>their infants,</hi> are <hi>there alſo ready to make a publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their fayth before the wholl Congregation.</hi> Reply. 1. How can they be called <hi>their infants,</hi> who, neither are their parents, nor have the education of them, and who, it may be, ſhall ſcarſe ever ſee them againe after that time? 2. what profeſſion of faith is it to ſay yea, or to nodd the head at a few words, in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, which they underſtand not many times, or regard not when they are uttered, it being done by perſons otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne? It is a bad cauſe which muſt be pleaded for after this manner, when the Advocate flyeth from it, and in part hideth it, as a thing whereof he is aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>The 5. Text is, 1. Cor. 5.12. which was alleadged to ſhew that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:20023:171" rendition="simple:additions"/> Church ordinances, (i. e. ordinances which are given to the Church) belong onely to the members of ſome particular Church, which we apply to Baptiſme <hi>a pari,</hi> from the parity betweene it and another Church ordinance, namely the Church cenſures, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in that place, and limiteth onely to thoſe that are within the Church, as belonging onely to them, and not to <hi>thoſe without.</hi> Upon the ſame ground may I limit Baptiſme (which is another Church ordinance) to thoſe that are of a true Church and ſo within, excluding all others from it, as men, in that reſpect, without. And herein what can be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? will they deny that Baptiſme is an ordinance belonging to the Church? The Scripture is cleare for it.

                  <p>Will they deny that Church ordinances are limited to thoſe that are in communion with the Church? Reaſon is againſt it, taken from the title that is given to the members of particular Churches, who are called <hi>Citizens with the Saints and, of Gods houſhold.</hi>

And, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme belongeth to thoſe onely who are in externall communion with a true Church, is not ſo ſtrange a doctrine in the Churches, whether of former or of latter times: For, former times did not onely deny baptiſme to thoſe that were infidells, but alſo to others that were not ſo farr <hi>without,</hi> even to beleivers, whileſt they were Catechumens; for theſe were not thought to be farr enough <hi>within,</hi> though they were <hi>in veſtibulo pietatis,</hi> and though they were <hi>meritô in Eccleſiâ,</hi> as the Schoolemen ſpeake, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not in it, <hi>numerô,</hi> that is, though they deſerved to be admitted, yet, becauſe they were not yet actually vnited with the Church, and numbred amongſt the members of it, they were not baptiſed. For latter times, that which we have ſhewen in the grant of Edw: 6. to Iohannes a Laſco, for the Churches of ſtrangers, in the 12 Section, is ſufficient.

For the third ſort I except againſt his implicite report of their practiſe, as imperfect and defective.

That they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely promiſe to bring up their children in the fayth that is profeſſed in thoſe Churches, whereas, 1. many of them doe not know, what that Religion is, nor at all live according to the rules of it, nor are joyned to any of the Reformed Churches.

            <p n="2">2. He ſayth, <hi>Injurious reports did not prevayle with him to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer them in wrighting.]</hi> The firſt part of this ſpeech is true. For I know not of any injurious reports that were ſpread concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, and therefore things that were not, could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to wright. But the ſecond part is untrue, as I have ſhewne already, in that he wrote a large letter to a freind of his in England, about the ſame time, when I wrote my breife an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, which containes the ſubſtance of this booke, ſo farr as concernes matters of fact.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He admoniſheth men to <hi>beware of importunity of freinds.]</hi>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:20023:174"/> Sollicitation of freinds, in ſome caſes, is to be regarded, and followed, as in caſes of this nature, when freinds ſollicite a man to diſcharge a bounden duety, ſuch as the declaring of the truth is, for the clearing of his owne innocency, neceſſity compelling thereunto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He ſayth, that <hi>to give a wrighting to two, might be as much as to give it to twenty.]</hi> It might be ſo, and it might be not, as the men might be. But, in this caſe, I am certaine, it was not ſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He ſayth, that <hi>my retayning of the originall copy doeth not more excuſe me, then if he that made a libell, &amp;c.]</hi> Nor did I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge it for an excuſe (for the fact needeth no excuſe, it being a manifeſt duety) but to ſhew that errours, and miſtakes might be in the printed copy, which I could correct by the originall, which J had in mine owne keeping, and ſo there were miſtakes indeed not a few. But how cometh he to compare this to a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell ſeing my name was to it againe and againe expreſſed?</p>
            <p n="6">6. He denieth that it was done, <hi>in a private way,</hi> becauſe I ſay, <hi>let the Reader judge,</hi> and that, <hi>it was done for the ſatiſfaction of the members of the Engliſh Church, &amp;c.]</hi> Seing I profeſſed to wright it for ſatiſfaction of thoſe Dutch or Engliſh, who were cauſeleſly praejudiced, it muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed that ſuch muſt read it, and that I intended ſo: elſe, why did I wright it? And what hindred but this ſatiſfaction might be given in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way, notwithſtanding that? Vpon this occaſion, he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants upon <hi>a picture printed in the title page of that proteſtation, which ſuits with my dealing in that matter,</hi> he ſayth. A thing which J never obſerved in mine, till I read it in his booke, and enquiring into the reaſon of it, J found that the Printer dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at the ſigne of the Fame, and hath ſuch a picture before his dore, &amp; his manner is to print it alſo, as his ſigne, in the bookes which he printeth. Was not the Anſwerer well imployed, when he ſpent his thoughts upon ſuch deſcants? How eaſily might I anſwer him (if I affected ſuch vanityes) with a like deſcant upon the firſt letter of his praeface, which is a great C. the firſt letter of Contention (as well as of Chriſtian) where a man ſtands like a Champion with his military weapons and troupes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fall into a veine of conjecturing, 1. who that Champion
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:20023:175"/> is. 2. what thoſe troupes meane. 3. who thoſe two are at the foote of the C, and divided from it by the lower ſtroke of it. 4. Why that dominering Champion pointeth with his finger one way, and caſteth his countenance another way, as it were, giving direction, concerning thoſe two men at the foote of the C, to one who ſeemeth to ſtand ready at his beck, and then tell him that his dealing ſuites well with this embleme, in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious paſſages. But I affect not to feed my ſelfe or others with froth and ſcumme.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He ſayth, <hi>the more private the way was, the greater was the injury to him.]</hi> He ſayth true, if it had bene an untrue or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe report. But it was true, and being ſo, the more publick it is, the worſe it will prove for him, I feare, in the iſſue of the printed conteſts, but it is his owne fault.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He ſayth, <hi>I aught much more to have written for ſatiſfying the members of my pariſh-Church in London about my leaving them.]</hi> Thus he muſt kick, becauſe he is ſkittiſh. For, what is this to the proteſtation? I let paſſe his ſcornefull gird at my pariſh-Church in London, which (that I ſay no more) was in no reſpect inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to his pariſh-Church in Nantwijch; neither will I anſwer by retorting a cenſure upon his Church in Amſterdam: nor indeed doe ſuch ſtrivings become the ſervants of Chriſt. But, how knowes he whether I have written to them, or not? And what need is there of my ſatiſfying them about my leaving them, which was done with their conſent? And, if others diſliked it, he ſhould have ſaid, who they are, and upon what grounds they diſliked it, or have ſent them to me, or directed me to them, that I might have ſatiſfyed them, as I thought I had done him, and doe perſuade my ſelfe, that I did, though his paſſion hath thus diſtempered him cauſeleſly, at preſent.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He quarrelleth <hi>my profeſſion of my hoping and praying for that which I have long expected, to wit, that God would ſweetly order and diſpoſe the ſpirits of paſtor and people, in that Church, to unity and concord,</hi> pretending that <hi>the wrighting,</hi> which I made in myne owne defence, <hi>ſerved to provoke unto further contention].</hi> That wrighting ſerved, in my intention, onely to declare the truth, upon urgent provocation and compulſion: and therein I was ſo
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:20023:175"/> farr from irritating any mens minds to ſtrife, that I forbare the report of ſome things, and mentioned other things ſparingly, &amp; favourably, contenting my ſelfe onely with ſhewing that <hi>he did not deſire me,</hi> but concealing how he hindred my ſetling there, to prevent inconveniences. As for their <hi>complaining,</hi> which he ſayth, <hi>they learned by myne example:</hi> he cannot forget that this was not the firſt cauſe, or time of their complaining, but that they had ſhewne their greivance for the like ill uſage of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my coming to Amſterſtam: nor was he <hi>forced</hi> thereby <hi>to publiſh an Apology,</hi> ſeing a private anſwer might have bene ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in that caſe, as hath bene ſhewen.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He ſpeaketh ſuſpiciouſly of thoſe concluſions, and wayes which, I hoped, <hi>might be agreed upon,</hi> for their mutuall peace and concord. What <hi>I meane by them,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>he knoweth not.]</hi> It was not my purpoſe to propound any concluſions, or wayes, for that purpoſe, but my hope was that God would direct them, after he had prepared their hearts to humble themſelves for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miſcarriages, and made them more pliable to his revealed will, then hitherto they have ſeemed to be. He blameth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my proceeding in this buiſenes. 1. That <hi>I did not admoniſh the ſuppoſed offender alone, or with witneſſes.</hi> But enough hath bene done that way both by my ſelfe and others, to draw him from the errour of his way, without any good ſucceſſe. Nor did I <hi>ſubſtitute</hi> any <hi>talebearers</hi> (ſuch courſes I abhorr) but furniſhed two freinds with Anſwers for my defence, in caſe any ſhould traduce me, or miſreport matters. The other paſſages in that anſwer have bene already examined elſewhere, and declared to proceed from no other cauſe, then needleſſe and cauſeleſſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, in his owne mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas I profeſſe my <hi>utter diſlike of that pamphlet, both for the unſeaſonablenes of the worke, and for the unreaſonable, and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable bitternes of the publiſher,</hi> he ſeemes to be diſcontented that <hi>I ſpeake not againſt the matter of the booke, nor againſt the authors thereof.]</hi> But how unjuſtly and vainely will be evident to him that ſhall conſider 1. That my proteſtation was onely againſt the publiſhing of it, with ſuch a title page, and poſtſcript, in which reſpects I called it a pamphlet 2. That the matter of it,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:20023:176"/> ſo farr as it concerneth me to examine, hath bene proved to be true in this Reply. 3. None of thoſe men (whom he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) had a hand in printing of it, but W. B. onely.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the threefold Quaere.] His firſt obſervation is, that <hi>theſe three Quaeres are confuſed and indiſtinct.</hi> Indiſtinct? when Paul confeſſed that he had bene <hi>injurious,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13:</note> did he meane that he had bene a buiſy body? when the Apoſtle Peter warneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers that <hi>none of them ſuffer as buiſy-bodies in other mens matters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15.</note> doeth he meane nothing elſe but as injurious perſons, or ſowers of diſcord? when Salomon reckoneth up, among the things which God hateth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.19</note> 
               <hi>him that ſoweth diſcord among brethren,</hi> doeth he meane nothing elſe then one that is injurious, or a buiſy-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? How ſlight is this chalenge! But how proveth he that theſe termes are ſo indiſtinct? Becauſe they all expreſſe the ſame thing But that doeth not prove that they are indiſtinct, unleſſe they expreſſe the ſame thing under the ſame reſpect. Nay rather, for that reaſon, they are diſtinct, becauſe they ſerve to expreſſe the ſame thing, in different reſpects, and ſo cauſe the apprehenſion to diſcerne diverſe evills in one, according to the diverſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of it, every one of which ſerveth to aggravate it. But, is this a juſt reward of my pleading for him? Is this his kindnes to his Freind?</p>
            <p>His ſecond obſervation is to ſhew wherein the publiſher was injurious. This the publiſher himſelfe hath already anſwered, in print.</p>
            <p>His third obſervation is <hi>to charge me with injuriouſnes many wayes, and this,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>according to my threefold Quaere.</hi> But, if my threefold Quaere doe indeed deſcribe many wayes of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſnes, then the termes are diſtinct, and not ſo confuſed, as in his firſt obſervation he pretended, ſo that he hath already contradicted himſelfe. But we will examine the particulars.</p>
            <p>Anſ: 1. For <hi>injuriouſnes</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Reply. Here I may returne upon him juſtly the accuſation, which he unjuſtly layed upon me of confuſed, and indiſtinct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. For, he ſayth, <hi>the firſt way</hi> of the many, <hi>wherein</hi> I have bene injurious is, 1. <hi>for injuriouſnes.</hi> Is this an elegant expreſſion, and worthy of him who is ſo quick in cenſuring? But I take
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:20023:176"/> no pleaſure in ſuch jejune criticall trifling. I mention it onely to ſhew how unjuſtly he reproacheth me with <hi>confuſed and indiſtinct Quares,</hi> wherein himſelfe hath found ſome diſtinction: elſe his wholl enſuing diſcourſe is confuſed and immethodicall. But, to come the matter.</p>
            <p>He ſayth that <hi>I have bene injurious, and a ſower of diſcord, and a buiſy-body for framing that wrighting, and leaving it in the hands of thoſe two perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reply. 1. Vpon what neceſſity I wrote it, and how W. B. publiſhed it, without my privity, hath bene ſhewne already. Now, that it may appeare how ſophiſtically he reaſoneth, we wil frame it into a Sylogiſme.</p>
            <p>He who leaveth in wrighting, with a freind or two, a neceſſary &amp; ſhort defence of his owne innocency againſt injurious reports, which afterwards is ſhewne to others, for their private ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by his appointment, or publiſhed by any, without his conſent, is injurious, a fower of diſcord, and a buiſy-body.</p>
            <p>But Mr. D. hath left ſuch a wrighting, which hath ſo bene ſhewne, and publiſhed. Therefore Mr D. is injurious, a ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of diſcord, and a buiſy-body.</p>
            <p>Is not this deepe accuſation, according to the threefold Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſoundly proved? In his next booke I expect that he prove his major Propoſition, which is falſe, and, till that be done, he lyeth bound (as by a threefold cable) in the guilt of a threefold ſlander.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that the Anſwerer laboureth to caſt the blame of every mans miſcarriage upon me, and ſtriveth to have me blamed, at leaſt, as the occaſion, if not as the cauſe of publiſhing that pamphlet, againſt which I proteſted, the Reader may ſee how far he is from the ſpirit of Beza, who dealt more favourably in a caſe far more offenſive. For, a ſcandalous booke which Eraſtus made againſt Eccleſiaſticall excommunication, was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, after the authours death, and with it ſome private letters of other men. What did Beza in this caſe? Did he fall foule upon thoſe men for wrighting ſuch things, and for giving occaſion thereby of having them publiſhed? No, but, in the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his booke againſt Eraſtus, he laboureth to free him from all ſuſpicion of cauſing it to be publiſhed, till his widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s affirmation, that upon his death-bed he commanded her, and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:20023:177"/> bound her with an oath to publiſh it, made that impoſſible to be hidden. Yet, even then, Reverend Beza carryed the matter, as one that ſuſpected rather her truth, then her huſbands guilt. And, whereas the evidence againſt him might ſeeme ſufficient to ſome, yet he would ſuppoſe that, if his hand was in it, it was done by him, <hi>non ſatis jam ſibi conſtante,</hi> when he was not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but diſtempered in his head, and ſharpeneth his ſtile, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Eraſtus the authour, but againſt Caſtelvetrus the publiſher for publiſhing that, &amp; with it, <hi>privatas magnorum virorum literas aliquot, certaine private letters of worthy men.</hi> Thoſe worthy men were Bullinger &amp; Gualter, whom he honoureth with the title of <hi>great men,</hi> (as he did Eraſtus alſo ſtiled by him, <hi>vir clariſſimus</hi>) notwithſtanding their difference from him in judgment, about that particular. And he giveth a good reaſon of his tartnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the publiſher. Becauſe, to divulge ſuch private wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <hi>quid aliud eſt quam tollere è vitâ, vitae ſocietatem, et amico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum abſentium colloquia. What is it elſe but to take from the life of man the ſociety of his life, and the conferences of abſent freinds?</hi> With what joy would Beza have imbraced ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of clearing thoſe men, as was put into the Anſwerers hands, if any of them had printed a proteſtation againſt the publiſhing of that booke, or of thoſe printed letters, though they had not ſhewne any diſlike of the matters contained in it! But from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary principles what can be expected but contrary actions?</p>
            <p n="4">4. For the three fold requeſt.] 1. My requeſt to him was, <hi>that he would reſt ſatiſfyed with my ingenuous profeſsion, in this particular.</hi> How he hath anſwered that, this booke ſheweth, and the accuſation immediately preceding, in his third obſervation, ſheweth, and his owne words in this place ſhew: For, when he cannot accuſe me of cauſing the publiſhing of it, yet he will miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge my intention, as if, for my owne credit, not for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Religion, or to him, I would not have it printed.</p>
            <p>My ſecond requeſt was <hi>to the publiſher,</hi> 1. <hi>to burne the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,</hi> 2. <hi>or to affixe my proteſtation to it, in ſtead of a poſtſcript,</hi> which ſeing he did not, I procured 450. as I take it, of the 500. to be bought, and kept up, the reſt having bene ſold before I could prevent it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:20023:177"/>5. He addeth that <hi>this my printed proteſtation contayneth in it a threefold publick provocation of him to anſwer my wrighting, more then he had before.</hi> As the odd numbers which were made even by the method, whereinto my proteſtation was accidentally caſt, are now made odd againe by this intimation of a threefold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation unjuſtly added thereunto: So the differences which I have many wayes laboured to compoſe and reconcile, he hath, by this contentious booke, and too much obſtinacy in his way, continued and increaſed. That this is added unjuſtly will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in examining the ſeverall pretended <hi>provocations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By my avouching that I wrote nothing but the truth in my decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.]</hi> Reply. It was neceſſary that I ſhould wright ſo much. Elſe it would have bene thought that I was guilty of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in that declaration, and therefore proteſted againſt the publiſhing of it, which alſo the Anſwerer frequently intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his ſuſpicious manner of ſpeaking, concerning <hi>tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing men in the darke.</hi> And that whatſoever I there wrote is true, this Reply doeth witneſſe ſufficiently. But what was there in that litle which I wrote in that declaration (which, except the letter to the Claſſis, was not halfe a ſheet of paper) to cauſe the publiſhing of a booke of above 20 ſheets of paper?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By intimating further matter which I have to add beſides that which I have already written.]</hi> Reply. This booke declareth it to be true which I then ſaid, and, upon further provocation, the next booke ſhall ſhew, with Gods aſſiſtance, that I have yet much more to ſay, and that I have but ſparingly replyed in this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe this printed proteſtation makes all more publick then they were before.]</hi> Reply. 1. Both booke and proteſtation were ſuppreſſed, after a few copies of the proteſtation had bene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, in favour of the Anſwerer, to free him (as much as in me lay) from any hurt that might come by the pamphlet, to which end, I am informed, it was of uſe, and doe not repent of that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of my love to the truth, though the Anſwerer have thus ill requited me, by rendring evill for good, one while repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that <hi>I made that proteſtation onely for my credit, being aſhamed of what I had written,</hi> another while, <hi>glorying that I

                  </gap>on, to keepe him from anſwering my wrighting, but I ſhould not ſo eſcape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if I ſhould ſet downe the provocations which he hath given me to make his reply, I might name 30 for 3. For the booke it ſelfe, whereunto this reply is made, is nothing elſe but <hi>a bundle of provocations.</hi> But, having thus diſcharged, in ſome weake meaſure, a neceſſary duety, though unwillingly, I reſt, deſiring rather, that, for the future, we may be more prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably excerciſed in <hi>conſidering one another to provoke to love and good workes.</hi> And, in that reſolution and deſire, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the iſſue of this unpleaſing taſke to the bleſſing of the <hi>onely wiſe God,</hi> who knoweth how to bring order, out of ſeeming confuſion, and aedification to his Church, out of thoſe very accidents and events, whereby Sathan ſeekes the ruine of it beſeeching him to compoſe the hearts of paſtors and people every where (and in that place ſpecially) to a conſcionable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the dueties of their relation mutually, &amp; ſo effectually to recover the Anſwerer out of theſe ſnares, by unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned repentance, that his Elder yeares may be a crowne of Glory, being found in the way of righteouſnes, and <hi>the flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made him Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer,</hi> may have plentifull cauſe of bleſſing God for making his old age fat and flouriſhing in the bleſſed fruits of paſtorall faythfullnes accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God by Ieſus Chriſt!
